			<p class="titulo"> Abstract</p>
			<p>Entrepreneurship is an issue that has positioned itself as a key element for decision-making by governments, in their aspiration to generate new alternatives for progress. Its involvement in education has led international organizations to consider it within their action plans, in the case of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development its incorporation is in sight, especially in high school. Law 1014 of 2006 in Colombia supports the entrepreneurship class at schools in the country, with the aim of motivating processes that increase job opportunities and improve the quality of life of the society.</p>

		<p>The responsibility of leading concrete actions in the classrooms according to this law falls on the teachers who, despite the lack of training in entrepreneurship at the university degrees, courageously assume this challenge. Reason why a discussion from the teachers' point of view in the framework of a qualitative investigation, through interviews and documentary analysis, configures an inquiry resulting from the approach to their experiences, concerns and needs for a quality teacher training, that assumes entrepreneurship based on the demands of the new millennium.</p>

		<p>Hence, this reflection article is inclined to present the tasks aimed at the implementation of entrepreneurship in high school, from the experience of the teachers and instructors of the National Learning Service, through an approach to the reality of some schools in the city of Bogota. As a result, it was possible to demonstrate their efforts, learn about their implementation style and uncover this immense field to explore within the lack of training offered by universities and institutions in charge of providing training to teachers and those who are being prepared to become ones.</p>

			<p class="titulo"> Resumen</p>
			<p>El emprendimiento es un tema que se ha posicionado como elemento clave para la toma de decisiones de los gobiernos en su aspiración de generar nuevas alternativas para el progreso. Su injerencia en la educación ha conducido a las organizaciones internacionales a contemplarlo al interior de sus planes de acción, en el caso de la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico se vislumbra su incorporación, especialmente en la educación media. La ley 1014 de 2006 en Colombia ampara la cátedra de emprendimiento en los establecimientos educativos del país, con el objetivo de motivar procesos que incrementen oportunidades laborales y mejoren la calidad de vida de la sociedad.</p>

			<p>La responsabilidad de liderar acciones concretas en las aulas atendiendo esta directriz recae en los docentes quienes, a pesar de la carencia de formación en emprendimiento en las licenciaturas asumen con valentía este reto. Motivo por el cual una discusión desde la óptica de los profesores en el marco de una investigación cualitativa, a través de entrevistas y análisis documental, configura una indagación fruto del acercamiento a sus experiencias, inquietudes y necesidades por una formación docente de calidad, que asuma el emprendimiento a partir de las exigencias del nuevo milenio.</p>
	
			<p>De allí que este artículo de reflexión se incline por presentar las labores encaminadas a la implementación del emprendimiento en la educación media, desde la vivencia de los maestros e instructores del Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, mediante un acercamiento a la realidad de algunos colegios de la ciudad de Bogotá. Como resultado fue posible evidenciar sus esfuerzos, conocer su estilo de implementación y develar ese inmenso campo por explorar dentro de la carente oferta de formación ofrecida por universidades e instituciones a cargo de proporcionar capacitación a los profesores en ejercicio y a quienes se preparan para serlo.</p>

		<p  class="titulo"> <b>Introduction</b> <p>

		<p>Entrepreneurs as "Change Agents" in the view of Casson & Casson (2013), are people who can be pressured to promote rapid change. An entrepreneur who does not have change ideas to push for can be changed by someone who does. The National Development Plan in Colombia argues that through entrepreneurship, economic and social changes can be generated, which for teachers become a challenge lacking accompaniment to support them in their work. In Colombia, with the law 1014 of 2006 "On the promotion of the culture of entrepreneurship", the topic is embraced, involving education and its interests, as well as the law 1429 of 2010 on formalization and generation of employment, assists the creation of companies for young people. From tenth and eleventh grade with the processes of articulation of high school with higher education, especially with the National Learning Service SENA, a company-school link is established and forges a new compendium of needs that teachers must face.</p>

		<p>Secondary education, which in Colombia is defined by Law 115 (1994) "its fundamental purpose is to prepare the student to access Higher Education, or Education for Work and Human Development" (Art. 27). (Art. 27), establishes that these are the last grades of school education in the country that have a specific labor or university purpose, aspects that converge to promote the teaching of entrepreneurship. In this last school stage, in accordance with Law 1014, it is necessary to "Promote innovative productive development, generating conditions of competition in equal opportunities, expanding the productive base and its entrepreneurial capacity". (Camacho, 2010, p.35). Because of this, public educational institutions have been forced to implement entrepreneurship without considering the training of teachers to address this issue.</p>

		<p>According to Díaz and Celis (2010): "Teachers in many cases perceive that the objective of their area is to generate units of self-employment or survival so that their students are occupied and have some income." (p.206). This perspective reinforces that entrepreneurship is conceived with a vision limited to the realization of business fairs that promote self-employment. According to the study of the Institute for Educational Research and Pedagogical Development IDEP Sanchez and Gutierrez (2013) "58% of the entrepreneurship teachers of the characterized schools are from fields and disciplines of administrative sciences or technical sciences. The remaining 42%, from the educational sciences." (p.191), i.e. they have an emphasis in administration or related fields and lack training in pedagogy or, on the contrary, pedagogues do not know about entrepreneurship.</p>

		<p>For this reason, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the experiences of entrepreneurship teachers in Bogota and their perspective on the need for training in this area. The voice of school teachers and SENA instructors is exposed in front of the deficit of initiative of the faculties of education to promote training programs in the field of entrepreneurship. Given that in the vision of Vergara (2016) "teaching practice is characterized by being dynamic (because of its constant changes), contextualized (because it is in situ) and complex (because the understanding is given according to time and space)." (p. 75). The teacher's practice in entrepreneurship education requires an approach that recognizes "the action that takes place in the classroom and, within it, with special reference to the process of teaching" (De Lella, 1999, p.2), a characterization of experiences of educational institutions that have concrete actions on the subject.</p>

	<!--Introducción-->
	<hr>
		<p  class="titulo"> <b>Theoretical framework</b> <p>

		<p><b>Entrepreneurship, schools and definitions.</b></p>

		<p>There are several definitions of the term entrepreneurship, which emerge from different schools of thought on the subject. These schools take as the central axis of their approaches, the way of perceiving the entrepreneur according to his interests, his behavior or simply his facet of creator. According to Cunningham & Lischeron (1991), there are 6 schools of entrepreneurship based on specific characteristics:</p>

				<span class="captionS"><b>Table I:</b>Summary of approaches for describing entrepreneurials.</span><br>
				<span><b>Source: </b>Cunningham & Lischeron (1991). (p.47).</span><br>

			</div>
		</p>

		<p>These schools, based on personal qualities such as intuition, persistence and self-esteem, are located in what the authors call the "Great Person" school. On the other hand, the school based on psychological characteristics emphasizes values, attitudes and needs focused on the achievement of objectives. The classical school coins innovation as the axis of growth of a productive idea. The management school emphasizes planning, production and capitalization for profit. For the leadership school, constancy is required to motivate and direct concrete actions. Finally, the intrapreneurship school supports the creation of independent market units and expansion of services.</p>

		<p>These definitions distinguish as a point of convergence the constant evolution of the individual towards economic growth, hence the Colombian government in its interest to embrace the international policies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD, the World Bank and other agencies, deploy concrete actions for the implementation of the subject in the classroom according to the needs of communities and resources available in the country.</p>

		<p><b>The implementation of entrepreneurship in secondary education in Colombia.</b></p>

		<p>With the intention of responding to the needs of entrepreneurship education in Colombia, Law 1014 (2006) is the first action that makes it mandatory for all educational institutions to incorporate this subject. However, this regulation requires its implementation from preschool to strengthen the culture and innovation in all educational cycles. The inclusion of the chair and the creation of a curriculum in schools have been supported by some guidelines offered by the Ministry of National Education MEN, such as guide 39: "The culture of entrepreneurship in educational institutions" in addition to its predecessors from 2006 and 2010 (Rico, Santamaría, 2018). These guides offered parameters for the construction of curricula for schools that entered the dynamics of entrepreneurship in their academic activities.</p>

		<p>Another decisive action for the incursion of the entrepreneurial world in the secondary education scenario was the program of articulation of secondary with higher education. It is a plan proposed by the MEN in 2008 whose objective according to the sectorial plan of education 2008 -2012: "It seeks the transformation of the schools in their pedagogical, administrative, physical and organizational environment in such a way that the 10th and 11th grades assimilate and deploy appropriate and pertinent contents and methodologies of higher education." (p.74). This program supports inter-institutional agreements with universities and institutions of technical education and technology in the country with schools.</p>

		<p>One of the most relevant strategic alliances of the educational institutions for the implementation of the articulation is the one established with SENA. This institution, as the flagship of education for work and entrepreneurship, offers programs that support schools in specific technical training in various fields. This cooperation is crystallized by means of teachers and/or instructors from SENA being linked to the educational establishments, the loan of laboratories and other spaces, as well as technical degrees for the students. These instructors, in association with the teachers, develop their work in the schools and daily evidence a network of relationships with the students, parents and community with the ultimate goal of building their own teaching practice in the field of entrepreneurship.</p>

		<p><b>Teaching practice and its connection with entrepreneurship in schools.</b></p>

		<p>Teaching practice, according to De Lella (1999), groups together a series of elements that build a constant interaction between teaching, learning and the community:</p>

		<p>The concept of practice also reaches other dimensions: the global institutional practice and its unavoidable links with the teacher's social practice as a whole. The potential of teaching for social transformation and democratization of the school is located at this level.</p>	

		<p>The resources available to schools to democratize the teaching practice in entrepreneurship create the necessary connection between the educational field and the productive sphere, in addition to alliances with higher education institutions. It is there where teaching practice becomes a conscious act, as stated by Vergara (2017) "practice cannot be performed without some awareness of the purposes that guide it and without some knowledge of the object that is intended to change or modify." (p.77). As a result, teachers require continuous training that provides them with this knowledge to enrich their practice in the field of entrepreneurship and strengthen the changes they wish to inspire.</p>

	<!--Methodology-->
	<hr>
		<p  class="titulo"> <b>Methodology</b> <p>

		<p>This work is based on semi-structured interviews with 4 teachers of entrepreneurship in secondary education, 3 instructors, 2 SENA program coordinators and 1 teacher manager of an official school, in addition to the documentary analysis of entrepreneurship in secondary education. In this way, a qualitative study of descriptive character was configured, which evidences the practice of teachers in their daily life, reflecting their concerns, expectations and needs, as part of their humanity. This qualitative approach is interested in people in constant evolution, an aspect that for Denzin & Lincoln (2005) shows that: "The terrain of qualitative research, therefore, is the world of lived experience, since this is where individual beliefs and actions intersect with culture". (p. 8). The world and the phenomena to be known, revolve around entrepreneurship as a culture and the way it is approached in secondary education in schools.</p>

		<p>For Flick (2004), qualitative research "takes into consideration that practices and points of view in the field are different because of different perspectives" (p.20). As a consequence, by meeting directly with teachers and instructors, it is possible to identify relationships between them and the subjects around them, a fundamental element for reflection. It is then, where the director, school teachers, instructors and SENA coordinators, enable a dialogue between the various experiences gathered, the current regulations and the visions they assume regarding the government policy on teacher training in entrepreneurship.</p>

		<p>The inquiry about the strategies they have designed to implement entrepreneurship in their institutions facilitated the approach to their process of incursion and adoption in secondary education, from the teachers and the panorama of their existing practice in the schools, all permeated under the mantle of the public educational policy.</p>

	
	<!--Results and discussion-->
	<hr>
		<p  class="titulo"> <b>Results and discussion</b> <p>

		<p>In the dialogue established with secondary education teachers, instructors and coordinators, belonging to SENA, whose role is to develop accompaniment in the schools that have articulation, it is found that there is a large gap between the expectation generated when addressing entrepreneurship in schools and the reality, given that: "The subject of entrepreneurship is assigned to some teacher who is not tenured or who has no knowledge of the subject, simply tries to do some project" (Entrepreneurship teacher 1). "Entrepreneurship in SENA, is not worked as a transversal area, Law 1014 is not being applied. The people in charge of giving workshops in this area are those in charge of welfare" (Coordinator 1 SENA). In other words, the aspirations expressed in the regulations are different from the processes experienced by teachers, especially in the management of information in the area.</p>

		<p>In addition, regarding the needs and expectations for the implementation of entrepreneurship in daily teaching practice, it was possible to identify that: "First, the educational stage must be strengthened, because educators in different areas, especially in entrepreneurship, do not have a pedagogy that is innovative, everything is always a faithful copy of the original". (Instructor 3). The following table shows a part of the analysis of the interviews with the participants, regarding their point of view on the future of entrepreneurship in educational institutions.</p>

		<p>

				<span class="captionS"><b>Table II:</b>Apart from the interview with teachers, instructors, coordinators and managers.</span><br>
				<span><b>Source: </b>Author.</span><br>

			</div>
		</p>

		<p>There was a reiterated complaint among teachers, instructors, coordinators and managers regarding the urgent need for training in entrepreneurship, given that they work based on the guidelines offered by some ministry documents that do not provide sufficient information for teaching practice on the subject. "Train teachers because teachers know very little about entrepreneurship. Learning entrepreneurship or teaching entrepreneurship is not done by means of just a board and marker, you have to develop skills in the students." (Entrepreneurship teacher 3). The role of the university is fundamental in the future of teacher training in entrepreneurship based on the shortcomings evidenced.</p>

		<p>Regarding teaching practices in the field of entrepreneurship, it was possible to recognize that: "I would say that in most educational institutions it is being taught in a traditional way. They transmit knowledge about what is the business model. It is a business plan that future entrepreneurs have not developed the skills and competencies that an entrepreneur really needs, especially an entrepreneur for the 21st century" (Entrepreneurship teacher 4). There is a deep-rooted sense of the production of products at fairs, as the pinnacle of the teaching work in the area.</p>

		<p>The objectives pursued by the teaching of entrepreneurship vary according to the experience of the teachers and the alliances established within the framework of technical training, and the goals for SENA are based on the success of the presentation of the productive project. The teaching practice in entrepreneurship is strongly governed by the SENA guidelines, confronted with a study advanced by Rico and Santamaría (2018) in Bogotá schools that shows that technical training, is a vital element, which directly affects the implementation of entrepreneurship in schools, given that: "The relationship between the P.E.I and the entrepreneurship chair in schools, revolves around technical training programs and training in General Labor Competencies CLG. Their transformations depend on the profile of the technical training programs" (p.110). The impact of SENA practices within the articulated schools is closely linked to the actions currently developed by teachers in their classroom activities.</p>

	<!--Conclusions-->
	<hr>
		<p  class="titulo"> <b>Conclusions</b> <p>

		<p>In the field of entrepreneurship in secondary education in schools in Bogota, the need to generate institutionalized policies that allow training teachers stands out, given that they have limited knowledge in entrepreneurship and considering the study of Cadena (2017): "It is required that the teacher has specific knowledge that guides him/her on how a student with an entrepreneurial attitude should be formed" (p. 224). Therefore, the intervention of universities and institutions in charge of training teachers in undergraduate programs should be more dynamic in the subject of entrepreneurship as an immense field to be explored.</p>

		<p>The practice of entrepreneurship teachers is permeated by the philosophy of SENA as manager of the subject in education and thanks to the program of articulation of high school with higher education, since it welcomes the guidelines offered by this institution that in general are inclined to motivate the consolidation of productive projects as the culminating stage of the process of entrepreneurship in high school, but require more focus on the life project rather than a purely productive vision, given that: "It is not enough with some productive linkage options and educational continuity from tenth and eleventh grade onwards, much more is needed for students in district schools to improve their competencies" (Zamudio and Velásquez, 2012, p. 148 ).</p>

		<p>The actions undertaken by the MEN, the SED, the universities and other institutions involved in the issue of entrepreneurship in Bogotá schools have focused their efforts essentially on supporting the articulation of secondary education with the productive environment, supporting interinstitutional agreements that allow the linkage of SENA instructors to schools, However, they have neglected the urgent need to consolidate training alternatives for teachers in this area, noting the teaching experience, the variety of disciplinary training lines that teachers who manage entrepreneurship in schools have and the motivation to include it, for example, in the university curriculum of bachelor's degrees and continuing education programs PFPD.</p>

		<p>A fundamental challenge is posed by listening to the voices of teachers and entrepreneurship instructors working in secondary education, the challenge of creating alternatives for teacher training in entrepreneurship that consider diverse skills and that are in line with the advancement of science and technology. Which coincides with the perspective of Cortés, Parra, Rojas and Gutiérrez (2017) concerning entrepreneurship policy in Colombia "teacher and administrative staff training, and its transmission to students, must take into account the future of a knowledge society, its changes, and its local influence." (p.107). This is a horizon ready to be studied and expanded not only by trainers and researchers in education, but also by those responsible for generating the country's educational policy.</p>

                Acoustic Emission (AE) is a proven successful Non-Destructive
                Testing (NDT) method to assess the state of storage tank floors. Traditional
                AE source location in tanks floors is performed using only the wavefronts that
                have traveled directly from the source to the sensor (direct hit). The wavefronts
                captured after reflected from the tank walls are identified and discarded. This
                paper proposes a new AE source location algorithm in tanks that considers a
                combination of reflections and direct hits. The proposed algorithm is based on
                time symmetry acoustics and ray theory. The methodology uses the concept
                of time symmetry acoustics in which a wave detected at any location can be
                directed back to the source when re-created at the detection place. Therefore,
                the developed approach takes the time at which each wave arrives to the sensor
                and sends it back as if time had reversed. Ray theory is used in the methodology
                to account for the way in which the wavefront is reflected when encounters
                an obstacle such as the walls of the tank. Then, the point of intersection of
                all wavefronts is identified using an optimization algorithm. This point where
                all wavefronts intersect is considered the location of the source. The location
                algorithm considers the first path or direct hits from the source to the sensors
                combined with reflections obtained by wavefronts bouncing from the tank
                walls. The proposed location algorithm was validated using numerical data
                from 176ft diameter tank and experimentally using AE data from a tank 55ft
                diameter.

            <p>
                Emision Acústica (AE) es una metodología exitosa y que ha sido
                probada de Ensayos No-Destructivos (NDT) comúnmente utilizada para
                determinar daño en el piso de tanques de almacenamiento. Tradicionalmente
                la localización de fuentes de AE en el piso del tanque se realiza utilizando
                únicamente las formas de onda que han viajado directamente de la fuente al
                sensor (golpe directo). Las formas de onda capturadas después correspondientes
                a las reflecciones son identificadas y eliminadas. Este artículo propone un
                nuevo algoritmo de localización de fuentes de AE en tanques que considera
                una combinación de ondas reflejadas y golpes directos. El algoritmo propuesto
                se basa en acústica de simetria temporal y la teoría de rayos. La metodologia
                usa el concepto de acústica de simetria temporal en el cual una onda detectada
                en cualquier lugar se puede dirigir de nuevo a la fuente cuando se recrea en el
                lugar de detección. Entonces, la metodología desarrollada aquí toma el tiempo
                al cual la onda llega al sensor y la envía de vuelta como si el tiempo se hubiera
                devuelto. La teoría de Rayos se utiliza en la metodología para considerar la
                forma en la que el frente de onda se refleja cuando encuentra un obstáculo
                tal como la pared del tanque. El punto de intersección de todos los frentes de
                onda es identificado utilizando un algoritmo de optimización. Este punto donde
                todos los frentes se intercepta es considerado el punto de localización de la
                fuente. El algoritmo de localización considera el primer camino o el camino
                directo de la fuente a los sensores combinado con la reflecciones obtenidas por
                los frentes de onda que rebotaron de las paredes del tanque. El algoritmo de
                localización propuesto fue validado usando datos numéricos de un tanque de
                176 pies de diámetro y datos experimentales usando datos de AE provenientes
                de un tanque de 55 pies de diámetro.

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>

        <p>
            Above ground liquid-filled tanks are
            indispensable in many industries such as oil
            refineries, chemical plants and power plants. The
            bottom of above ground tanks are made of steel and
            are exposed to different chemicals and vibrations.
            The floor of these tanks are subjected to different
            stresses and susceptible to the development of
            cracks and corrosion. The bottom of the tank results
            very difficult to inspect while the tank is still in
            service using most Non-Destructive Methods (Cole
            and Gautrey 2002). In order to access the floor,
            the tank has to be emptied and cleaned, which can
            make the inspection very expensive. Traditionally
            the floor of the tank is inspected in a “Leak-based”
            or a “Time-based” maintenance practice. In the
            “Leak-based” practice, tanks are taken out of
            service and inspected when a major problem such
            a leak appears. This practice is banned in most countries. In the “Time-based” approach tanks are
            inspected periodically. The result is that many tanks
            are emptied and cleaned without a real need. For
            instance, Saudi Aramco reports possible savings
            of more than US$50M if the unnecessary emptied
            and cleaned of tanks is avoided (Cole and Gautrey
            2002). There has been a lot of research on trying to
            develop a reliable method of inspection of the tank
            bottom that does not require emptying the tank,
            including robots with ultrasound probes that scan
            the bottom (Schempf, Chemel et al (1995), da Cruz,
            and Ribeiro (2005)) or using guided waves that
            travel along the shell of the tank floor (Rizzo, Han
            et al (2010), Chen, Su et al (2010), Mazeika, Kazys
            et al (2011)). One very successful method to assess
            the state of the floor of the tank while in service is
            by using Acoustic Emission (AE).
        </p>

        <p> AE is a passive Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)
            method that has successfully been used for Structural
            Health Monitoring applications (Zárate and Caicedo et al 2012, Zárate and Pollock et al 2015, Momeni
            and Koduru et al 2013, Aggelis and Barkoula et
            al 2012). AE uses acoustic waves typically in the
            range of 100 kHz to 1 MHz, propagating through
            a material. These waves are created by events in
            the material such as the formation or growth of a
            crack (Scruby 1987) or a chemical process such as
            active corrosion. The transient waves are converted
            into a voltage by AE sensors, and digitalized by the
            data acquisition system. The waveforms obtained
            are processed and hit features such as waveform
            maximum amplitude, duration, absolute energy,
            and rise time are calculated (Nair and Cai 2010).
            An amplitude threshold is used to trigger the “hit”
            (the processing of an individual AE waveform)
            and determine the time of arrival. AE has gained
            popularity within the NDT community because
            of several advantages (Shigeishi, Colombo et al.
            2001) compared to other NDT methods including:
            i) allows in-service online monitoring; ii) geometric
            independence; iii) simple and economic installation;
            and iv) wireless nodes available in the market
            (Godinez-Azcuaga, Inman et al. 2011). </p>

        <p> AE is used as a method for global qualification
            and inspection of above ground storage tanks floors.
            The sensors are located at the outer surface of the
            tank along the inferior circumference at a distance
            of 3 to 6 feet above the bottom knuckle as shown
            in Figure 1. Notice that in this specific application
            the acoustic event is started at the floor of the tank
            by the active leak or corrosion, then the wave goes
            to the liquid in the tank and from there to the outer
            shell or wall of the tank. Therefore, the medium
            for the wave to travel from the source of the event
            to the shell or wall of the tank is the liquid filling
            the tank. AE tests are designed so that AE detects
            a discontinuity and determines the region where
            is suspected. The AE method then grades the tank
            and evaluates the need to empty the tank for further
            inspection. The method relies on the location of
            the events in the plane of the floor of the tank for
            its grading. The events are localized based on the
            difference of arrival time of the hits that compose the event. The assumption in here is that each hit
            correspond to a direct arrival of the wave coming
            directly from the source. However, waves traveling
            in liquid filled structures can travel a long distance
            because of the low attenuation. The wave bounce
            of the walls of the tank creating reflections that
            can be mixed with the direct hits. The result is a
            combination of direct hits and reflections in the
            times of arrival, which causes errors in traditional
            location algorithms. </p>

        <p> Reflections caused by the wave bouncing from
            the tank wall can be considered into the location
            algorithm by using time reverse acoustics. The
            concept of time-reversed acoustics is based on
            the reciprocity property of the wave equation and
            expresses that a wave detected at any location can
            be directed back to the source when re-created at
            the detection place. Taking the time at which each
            wave arrives to the sensor and sending it back as if
            time had reversed. The point where all wavefronts
            intersect is considered the location of the source.
            Applications of time reversal for damage location in
            active sensing have been proposed in the literature.
            For instance, Anastasi (2011), Xu and Giurgitiu
            (2007), Wang and Rose et al (2004), and Sohn and
            Park et al (2007) developed methods for damage
            location using time reversal with guided waves.
            These algorithms allow locating damage in plates
            using an array of sensors some of them acting as
            receivers and others as sources. Algorithms for the location of sources considering the fact that the
            arrival wave may not be directly coming from the
            source have been developed in the literature as well.
            For instance, Parot (2006) developed a methodology
            for locating sources in an open space assuming
            obstructing rigid bodies between the source and the
            receiver. The concept of time reversal was used to
            locate the source based on the waves arriving to the
            receivers. The methodology was tested numerically
            using different propagation models including a
            ray tracing model and a full diffraction model. In
            all cases the source was located showing that the
            time reversal technique can be used to located
            sources with very few transducers. Albert and Liu
            et al (2005) developed an algorithm for source
            location in an urban environment that considers
            the wave being reflected from rigid objects before
            reaching the receiver. The urban environment was
            modeled using a Finite Element Model. By setting
            the receivers as sources, the sound refocuses in the
            vicinity of the original source. This indicates that
            with few non-line-of-sight sensors the source of
            the emission can be located. Nevertheless, the use
            of time reversal in passive methods such as AE for
            damage location is scarce in the literature. Horn
            (1996) developed an algorithm for the location of
            AE sources in structures that use time reversal. The
            methodology is designed to work in plates assuming
            the wave does not take a direct path from the source
            to the sensor. The methodology uses azimuth AE
            sensors which detect the orientation of the wave.
            Then, the measured wave orientation is used to
            direct a ray tracing model along the structure, which
            is used to find the location of the source. Even
            though methodologies for source location that do not
            assume a direct path between sensor and source are
            available in the literature, there is no methodology
            available for locating AE sources on the floor of
            liquid filled tanks that considers reflections. </p>

        <p> Traditional location algorithms locate sources
            on tank floors using only direct arrival wave data.
            Reflections of the wave bouncing at the tank wall
            are discarded by choosing a proper Event Definition Value (EDV). However, very often the EDV is
            large enough to allow the inclusion of reflections
            within the wave arrival data confusing the location
            algorithm. This paper proposes an algorithm for
            locating AE events at the floor of tanks considering
            a mixture of reflections and direct paths wave
            arrivals. The proposed algorithm is formulated using
            concepts of time-reversed acoustics and ray theory.
            Ray theory is used in here to model the wavefront
            reflected when encounters an obstacle such as the
            walls of the tank. The concept of time-reversed
            acoustics is used to allow sending back the waves
            detected by the sensors to the source. Then, the
            point of intersection of all wavefronts is identified
            using an optimization algorithm. This point where
            all wavefronts intersect is considered the location of
            the source. The proposed time location methodology
            is validated using numerically generated data from
            a tank 176ft in diameter filled with gasoline and
            experimental data with a tank 55ft diameter tanks
            filled with AVGas.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Wave propagation in liquid filled tanks and
            time reversal </p>

        <p> AE Sources located at the bottom of liquid filled
            tanks generate waves that propagate through the shell
            and passes to the liquid. The liquid creates a medium
            for the wave to leak away from the solid. A portion
            of the energy makes it in to the water generating
            waves that can travel a long distances in the low
            attenuation of liquid. The waves propagating in the
            liquid are governed by the equation: Please notice
            that in this particular application the assumption is
            that the wave travels thru the liquid to the outer shell
            or wall of the tank, not from the metallic bottom
            directly to the wall of the tank. </p>

        <p> where V, is the velocity of the sound in the liquid,
            F, is the acoustic pressure field and t, is time. Notice that time appears only once in a second derivative
            term. This implies that if F(r,t) is a solution of the
            equation, then F(r,-t) is a solution as well (Fink
            1992). In other words, if S(r,t)is a wave generated
            at the source, which is detected at the receiver as
            R(r,t). Then R(r,-t) generated at the receiver will
            be detected as S(r,-t) at the source (Parot 2008).
            Therefore, in order to obtain the location of the AE
            source the waves detected by the receivers have
            to be replayed back and the place where all waves
            intercept correspond to the location of the source.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Ray tracing model </p>

        <p> Ray tracing is a methodology to model
            wavefronts as they are reflected when encounter
            an obstacle like the wall of the tank. Ray theory
            is based on the simple assumption that wavefronts
            can be modeled as a series of discrete beams or
            rays that follow the reflection law. In other words,
            the continuous wave front is modeled by using a
            finite number of rays (Essl (2006)). Ray tracing has
            been successfully applied in different fields such
            as seismology (Bai, Hu et al (2014)), architectural
            acoustics (Serrano, Guillem et al (2014)) and
            graphics (Wald, Slusallek (2001)). </p>

        <p> Let a ray front emanate from a point located
            at the circumference at the equator of a circle of
            unitary radius. Then, the position of the ray can be
            written to account for reflections as the ray bounces
            according to the reflection law as: </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/v11-N1-8/img3.jpg" height="550px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p> where X<sub>j</sub>
            , is the X position of the ray, Y<sub>j</sub>
            , is the
            Y position of the ray, l<sub>j</sub>
            , is the distance covered by
            the ray before being reflected at the tank wall, θ, is
            the angle measured from the radius of the circle
            to the path of the ray as shown in Figure 2. Once
            the ray hits the wall, the position of the ray can be
            calculated by rotating and translating Eqns. (2) and (3) accordingly. Therefore the position of the ray
            can be calculated at any instant of time.</p>

         <p> This simple concept allows for the calculation
            of the position of the wavefronts at any instant of
            time, given the position of the source at the ring
            of the tank and the speed of the wave in the liquid.
            Notice that the ray tracing model used in here is
            limited to the position of the waveform at a given
            instant of time and does not consider attenuation,
            neither interference caused by the interaction of the
            different wavefronts. In consequence it is possible
            to obtain the time of arrival from this model, but not
            its amplitude. </p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Source location algorithm </p>

        <p> Structural Health Monitoring of above ground
            storage tanks using AE relies in the proper location
            of the events. Leaks and corrosion at the bottom of
            the tank generate AE events that are captured by
            the sensors. Location algorithms find the position
            of the source based on the time of arrival of the
            wave to the different sensors. Then, the difference
            in time between the first arrival and all subsequent
            hit arrivals ∆T, is calculated. Traditional location
            algorithms use the ∆t
            i correspondent to the i-th hit to determine the location of the event, based on the
            theoretical time that would take the wavefront to
            arrive from the event location to the i-th sensor as
            expressed in the following </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/v11-N1-8/img4.jpg" height="100px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p> where x<sub>1</sub>
            and y<sub>1</sub>
            are the coordinates of the
            first sensor detecting the wave; x<sub>i</sub>
            and y<sub>i</sub>
            are the
            coordinates of the i-th hit detecting the wave; x and
            y are the coordinates of the source location; and V
            is the velocity of the wave in the liquid. Therefore,
            using the least square method the location that best
            matches the time of arrivals can be calculated. </p>

        <p> On the other hand the proposed time reverse
            acoustic algorithm considers that the time t
            si taken
            for each wavefront detected to travel from the
            source to the sensor can be calculated using the
            corresponding ∆t<sub>i</sub> as </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/v11-N1-8/img5.jpg" height="200px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p> where t <sub>s1</sub> is the time that takes the wave to travel
            from the source to the first sensor that detects it; and
            and l<sub>i</sub> is the distance traveled by the wavefronts from
            the sensors that detect it. </p>

        <p> The arrival times are used to obtain Eqn. (5) and
            the wave is propagated from the sensor that detected
            it. The correspondent wavefront is calculated using
            the ray theory model of Eqns. (2) and (3) for an
            angle θ<sub>j</sub> that varies between -π/2 to π/2. Then, the
            distance between wavefronts is minimized using
            an optimization algorithm. The source of the AE is
            located at the intersection of all wavefronts. Notice
            that in the proposed time reverse AE methodology
            the minimization process aims to find only one
            variable, the value of t
            s1 that represents the time
            at which all waves intercept, while traditional algorithms aim to find two variables x and y.
            Furthermore, in this methodology a minimum of 3
            hits is required to locate a source. However, the 3
            hits could be obtained from only 2 different sensors.
            Therefore, the methodology requires a minimum of
            2 sensors to locate an AE source at the floor of a
            tank. </p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Numerical validation </p>

        <p> The proposed methodology to locate AE events
            at the floor of tanks was validated numerically using
            simulated events from source located at x= 40ft
            and y= 20ft on the floor of a tank. The tank was
            monitored with 15 sensors equally spaced along
            the ring of the tank and assumed 176ft diameter
            and filled with gasoline, which has a wave speed of
            4101ft/sec. The wave traveling through the liquid
            and being reflected from the walls was modeled by
            discretizing the differential equation (1). </p>

        <p> Let us rewrite equation (1) as </p>

        <p> where b = V∆t, assuming ∆x and ∆y are unitary. This solution of the wave equation allows to obtain
            both the location and amplitude of the wave at any instant of time as shown in Figure 3. </p>

        <p> The times of arrival of the wavefront to the sensors was recorded and include direct paths as well as
            reflections. Table 1 shows a selected number of hits with the correspondent time the wave took to arrive to
            the sensors. Then the arrival times in Table 1 are used to feed the proposed time reverse AE and the
            traditional location algorithm for locating the source.</p>

        <p class="titulo"> Results </p>

        <p> Table 1 shows a selection of numerically generated hits that correspond to direct paths and reflections.
            The source was located using three scenarios: i) only direct hits, ii) combination of direct hits and
            reflections,
            and iii) using only 2 sensors. Table 2 shows the results of the location for the traditional and the
            proposed
            algorithms. The results show that the time reverse AE location algorithm, is able to deal with a mixture of
            reflected waves and direct paths and present an error of about 0ft. While the traditional location algorithm
            pointed to complete different areas of the tank for the case that reflections were included and only two
            sensors were used. This shows that the proposed algorithm can be used with only 2 sensors as long as there
            are at least three hits. </p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Experimental validation </p>

        <p> The time reverse AE location methodology proposed in here was validated experimentally using two
            events from a tank bottom test. The events were obtained from a 55ft diameter, filled with AVGas with wave
            velocity of 3608ft/sec. The test was performed using 6 AE sensors with a PCI8 system manufactured by
            Mistras Group. The sensors were installed equally spaced at a distance of three feet from the ground and
            AE data was captured for a period of 30 minutes. Table 3 shows the hit sequence that compose the events
            that include a direct hits and a reflection. Notice, that the sequence of channels and the similar
            difference in
            times indicates that both events point to the same location. </p>

        <p class="titulo"> Results (Repeat tittle, wait for revission)</p>

        <p> The events presented in Table 3 are composed of three direct hits and one reflection. The times of
            arrival of the hits presented in Table 3 were used to locate the event using the time reverse AE methodology
            proposed in here and the traditional location algorithm. Two scenarios were considered: i) only direct hits
            (hits 1 to 3) and ii) direct hits and the reflection (hits 1 to 4). Table 4 shows the calculated location
            for
            the event considering both scenarios and both proposed and traditional algorithm. Results show that both
            algorithms locate to the same region of the tank with a difference of less of 1ft when dealing only with
            direct
            hits. However, only the proposed time reverse AE algorithm can point to the same region of the tank within
            3ft of difference when the reflection is included. </p>

        <!-- Conclusions -->
        <hr>
        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions </p>

        <p> This paper presents the formulation and validation of a time reverse acoustics methodology to locate the
            source of AE events at the bottom of liquid filled above ground tanks. The methodology uses the waveforms
            captured by AE sensors spread along a ring of the outer surface of the tank to locate the AE event. The
            proposed methodology considers the direct hits from the source to the sensor as well as the reflections
            from the tank wall. The outcome is the location of the event at the bottom of the tank without the need of
            identifying and eliminating reflections. </p>

        <p> The proposed methodology uses a ray tracing
            model of the wavefront traveling through the liquid
            and accounts for the direct paths as well as the
            reflections caused by the walls of the tank. Then the
            time reverse acoustics is used to send the wave back
            to the source as if time had reverse and the point of
            intersection of the wavefronts is identified using an
            optimization algorithm. </p>

        <p> The proposed methodology was validated
            using numerically generated data from a 176ft
            diameter tank and experimental data obtained
            from a 55ft diameter tank. Results show that the
            proposed framework calculates the location of the
            AE event including the reflections from the tank
            wall. Furthermore, the proposed methodology has
            the ability to locate the source of the AE event with
            fewer sensors than traditional AE location. </p>

        <p> The development in accuracy obtained through
            the use of ray theory and time reverse acoustics,
            can eventually lead to significant improvements in
            source location technology for above ground storage
            tank floors. It is not proposed that this methodology
            replace the traditional location algorithms currently
            used in well-established test procedures. But in
            specific events where the traditional location
            algorithm fails to locate because of the inclusion of
            reflections, the proposed reversed acoustic source
            location can improve the location of the event. </p>

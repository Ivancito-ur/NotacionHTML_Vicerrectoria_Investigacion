                    This document estimated the behavior of the CO2 flux in the San Andrés Islas maritime for the first
            half of 2019. This behavior was established based on the thermodynamic relationship between the sea
            surface temperature, the partial pressures of CO2 in the atmosphere, and the water column, this from
            data derived from remote sensors. The satellite data were derived from the MODIS aqua sensors and
            the MERRA model for sea surface temperature and wind speed respectively. Satellite images were
            obtained from NASA databases, subsequently processed and specialized in ArcGis 10.1. Finally, the
            behavior of the CO2 flux is shown for the San Andrés Islas maritime, finding that it does not tend to
            capture CO2, so acidification processes are discarded for the selected study period.

                    En el presente documento se estimó el comportamiento del flux de CO2 en el maritorio de San Andrés
            Islas para el primer semestre de 2019. Dicho comportamiento se estableció a partir de la relación

            bases de datos de la NASA, posteriormente procesadas y especializadas en ArcGis 10.1. Finalmente,
            se muestra el comportamiento del flux de CO2 para el maritorio de San Andrés Islas, encontrando que

        <!--Introducción-->
        <p class="titulo"> <b>Introduction</b>
        <p>

        <p>
            The anthropogenic CO2 is emitted in an approximate amount of 35,000 million [1] tons each year, mainly
            due to the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. This chemical species has attracted the
            attention of scientists around the world in recent years because a correlation has been observed between the
            proportional increase in global temperature [2] and, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere [3], [4],
            which is why it has been attributed as the main precursor to the phenomenon of climate change [5].
        </p>

        <p>
            In this sense, several investigations show the effects of CO2 on the atmosphere, climate and its consequent
            effects on some strategic ecosystems [6], [7], since around 46% of CO2 emitted (approximately 16,000
            tons/year) [8] remain in the atmosphere for several centuries, there being no consensus around their
            residence time; What is well known is the proportion of the remaining CO2: 54% [9] is absorbed in the
            continental and marine ecosystems [8] - [10], the highest proportion being that ending in the oceans, which
            is estimated between 30 and 40% of the total of the emitted CO2 [11], [12].
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore, understanding the behavior of CO2 in the Colombian maritime is essential for the conception of
            conservation strategies and public policies [13], [14] that allow the safeguarding of marine ecosystems,
            especially coral reefs [15]. This need is evident when reviewing environmental regulations in Colombia,
            where there is a gap around the mechanisms for monitoring and mitigating acidification by CO2 in the
            national maritime.
        </p>

        <p>
            That is why this article aims to show the behavior of CO2 in one of the main areas of coral reef coverage,
            San
            Andres Islands, which is located in the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve, and which houses 3% of the biodiversity
            of coral species and 33% of fish species, being one of the most diverse ecosystems in Colombia.

        <!-- Metodología y materiales -->
        <p class="titulo"> <b>Materials and methods</b>
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> <b>Study area</b>
        </p>

        <p>The San Andres Islands Archipelago is located in the transition zone between the humid and dry tropics (12-
            16 degrees’ latitude N. and 78-82 degrees’ latitude O.). Specifically, the island of San Andrés is 12.8 km
            long
            and 3 to 5 km wide, housing a diversity of marine ecosystems, the most relevant being coral reefs, prairie
            beds, sandy shorelines and, mangroves (16). The study area is shown in Figure I</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-2/img1.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>


        <p>
            The CO2 flux is conditioned by the thermodynamic relationships between the solubility of CO2 in seawater,
            the salinity of the environment, the differential of partial pressures of CO2 in the atmosphere and in the
            marine environment, and wind speed [17]. Among this group of variables, the action of the wind allows the
            interaction between the CO2 present in the atmosphere and the surface of some water, due to the action of
            the waves
            [18]. In this sense, the behavior of the CO2 flux [19] for the study area is defined from the expression
            (Equation
            1).

        </p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-2/img2.jpg" height="90px" width="auto">
        </div>


        <p>
            Where the CO2 flux (FCO2) is expressed in <span style="font-style: italic;">m</span>mol /m<sup>2</sup>
            /day. Where pCO2a is the partial pressure of CO2 in the
            sea, pCO<sub>2A</sub> the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere, S is the solubility of the gas and k is
            the rate
            of gas
            transfer [20].

        </p>

        <p>
            It is necessary to indicate that the CO2 flux values obtained through the previous one are negative when the
            ocean captures CO2 and therefore is a sink of this, and they become positive when the study area emits CO2
            product of ocean dynamics [21].
        </p>

        <p>
            Due to the logistical difficulty related to taking the in situ data of the oceanographic variables described
            in
            equation 1, each variable was decomposed into a set of physicochemical factors that can be determined from
            measurements made with remote perception [22].
        </p>

        <p>
            In this way it has to be that k is a function of the sea surface temperature [23] according to the following
            expression (Equation 2):
        </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-2/img3.jpg" height="120px" width="auto">

        </div>


        <p>
            Where U<sub>10</sub> is the wind speed at 10 m/s, Sc is the Schmidt number, which is a function of the SST,
            and the
            coefficient c and b, which are empirically obtained values.
        </p>

        <p>
            The transfer speed of a gas, in this case CO2, can be estimated by the relationship between the wind speed
            and
            its influence on the transfer constant (k). In this way, it is possible to assume that k is proportional to
            Sc, which
            can be obtained from equation 3.
        </p>

        <div class="image">

            <img src="img/V25-N3-2/img4.jpg" height="100px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>
            Thus, a third-order polynomial equation is established [24], which is based on the close dependence of
            Schmidt's number on sea surface temperature (SST) [25] for various gases present in the environment, and
            their
            behavior in fresh and marine water [26]. whose empirical coefficients are shown in table I.
        </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-2/img5.jpg" height="300px" width="auto">

        </div>

        <p>
            On the other hand, the second variable to consider is S, which depends mainly on temperature, pressure and
            salinity. According to the above, the variation in the solubility of CO2 is relatively low in relation to
            salinity,
            since this tends to be constant, while the variation in solubility is more influenced by the sea surface
            temperature
            [27], Therefore, the solubility of studies based on an adaptation of Henry's law and the Bunsen solubility
            coefficients [26], [28] were used, whose values can be seen in Table II:
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, the differential between the partial pressures of CO<sub>2</sub> on the sea surface and the
            atmosphere should
            be
            established, for which it is first proposed to calculate pCO<sub>2</sub> (expressed in μatm) in the water
            from the SST
            [29]
            (Equation 4).
        </p>


        <div class="image">

            <img src="img/V25-N3-2/img6.jpg" height="100px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>
            Where: A = 6.030; B = -0.06076; C = 0.0007021; D = 0.001655
        </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-2/img7.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">

        </div>

        <p>
            In this sense, pCO2 (expressed in μatm) will be assumed as constant (350.0 μatm) due to the low variability
            of
            the partial pressure of CO2 [30].
        </p>

        <p>
            Sea surface temperature (SST) data was downloaded from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
            (MODIS-AQUA) sensor [31] available at http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/, with a spatial resolution of 4 km
            and a daily temporary resolution.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the other hand, wind speed data were obtained from The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research
            and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2), a re-analysis of atmospheric data estimated by NASA with the
            Goddard Earth model Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5), where georeferenced wind speed
            information is obtained with a monthly temporal resolution and 1/8 degrees of spatial resolution, available
            from
            January 1980 to the present, available at The GES- DISC Interactive Online Visualization and Analysis
            Infrastructure (Giovanni) (https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/), which processes climatological and
            oceanographic data [32] obtained from remote sensors administered by NASA.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, with the purpose of calculating CO2 for the San Andrés Islas maritime, 11 points of strategic
            importance were taken for tourism and fishing activities, and three control points (C), distributed in the
            coral
            reef of the Island of San Andres The geographical location of these points is shown in table III.

            Figure II shows the dynamics of SST between January and June 2019, showing oscillations between 24 and 31
            ° C for this time of year. It can be seen on the maps that the area where San Andrés Islas is located
            presented an
            SST of ± 24.5 ° C, with March to April showing average values of 32 and 33 ° C, which is shown in figure
            III.

        <p>
            In the case of the study area, that is, the San Andrés Islas maritime, it was observed that the surface
            temperature
            ranges of the sea did not showconsiderable variation. The oscillation of the surface temperature of the sea
            oscillated between 24 and 35 ° C, being the months of April and May the ones that showed higher
            temperatures,
            which conditions the CO2 flux to the marine environment.
        </p>

            On the other hand, Figure IV shows the wind speed map (U10) obtained from the re-analysis with the MERRA

            In the same way, in figure V, the wind speed map (U10) obtained from the re-analysis with the MERRA model
            for the sanctuary of San Andres Islands between January and June 2019 is shown.

            From ArcGis 10.3, the satellite image information for the SST and U variables was extracted, and with the
            georeferenced values for the months between January and June 2019, CO2 flux calculations were made using
            equation 1 The georeferenced data of the CO2 flux is shown in Figure VI..

            Figure VI shows that the Colombian Caribbean is not a considerable CO2 sink, at least for the selected
            period
            of time. In this sense, the average values of CO2 flux were in the range between 398 and 495ppm in the
            oceanatmosphere direction, which would be showing that the occurrence of severe acidification phenomena for
            the
            Colombian Caribbean seafaring is despised. Despite this, it is necessary to carry out validations of the
            satellite
            data, as this would provide greater reliability to CO2 determinations through remote sensing techniques.

        <p>
            For the specific case of the San Andrés Islas maritime, little variability of the CO2 flux was observed,
            based on
            the average estimate derived from equation 1, is shown in table IV.

            From the values of sea surface temperature and wind speed for the sampling points, the interpolation of the
            CO<sub>2</sub> flux was obtained, whose ranges are shown in Figure VII.

        <p class="titulo"> <b>Conclusions</b></p>
        <p>
            From the estimation of the CO2 flux for the San Andrés Islas maritime, it can be said that it does not
            assume a
            significant sink trend, since the values for the selected study period were always negative, whose
            oscillation
            was between 390 and 405 mmol / m2
            / day approximately, discarding considerable acidification processes per
            CO2 account.

        </p>

        <p>
            This tendency in the behavior of the CO2 flow positively favors the survival of the coral structures present
            in the Seaflower reserve, since there is no considerable threat due to the alteration in the process of
            bioaccumulation of calcium carbonate, the main precursor to coral reefs.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the other hand, the impact of the CO2 flux on the abundance and distribution of ichthyo fauna is
            uncertain, mainly of those species of commercial interest for the San Andres Islands root communities.
            Finally, it is necessary to strengthen the research processes around the behavior of CO2 and its impact on
            the marine and coastal ecosystems of the Colombian Caribbean maritime.
        </p>

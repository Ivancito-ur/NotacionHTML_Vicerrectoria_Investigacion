                    The present work consisted of the simulation of the automatic control in the dome of a water tube
                    boiler, to know in detail the behavior of the level and pressure and its influence on the operation
                    of the boiler. To obtain the dynamics of each of the variables in the dome, the boiler software was
                    used. Different disturbances were performed in manual mode to collect data and later fit them to a
                    dynamic model. With the adjusted functions, a 2x2 MIMO multivariable control strategy was proposed,
                    which was validated with the relative gain criterion proceeding to the decoupling methodology. <br>
                    The parameters of each controller were tuned by the BLT method for multivariate systems and
                    validated with the Nyquist stability criterion. The 2x2 system was simulated in the Control Station
                    software with the controllers in automatic mode and step-type disturbances were performed to observe
                    the influence that each parameter of the PID controller has on the response time, oscillation and
                    offset of the controlled variables and their reflection on the other variables. With the criteria of
                    overshoot and rise time, each parameter was retuned. <br>
                    To ensure that the dynamics in the dome remains controlled, disturbances were made for servo control
                    and regulator control, obtaining satisfactory results for each system. PID controllers were shown to
                    respond quickly and efficiently.

        <!--Introducción-->
        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>
        <p>Since the invention of the steam engine in 1769 by Dionysius Papin and further developed by James Watt in
            1776, the steam engine has been the study of many. The first boilers were simply airtight metal vessels
            containing water in which a flame was lit underneath to heat them to produce steam. As welding and riveting
            techniques advanced, so did the boilers, but a major problem remained: they exploded due to the high
            pressure inside the metal container or the improper mixing of fuel to generate flame.</p>
        <p>To remedy this problem it was necessary to develop control systems in the boilers, starting with a simple
            manual control which included a barometer observed by a person who knew that if it passed a certain
            pressure, had to decrease the flame. Up to the new automatic and digital control systems that control
            pressure, temperature, water flow and fuel mixture in continuous boilers [1].</p>
        <p>In industry it is common to find processes that consist of two or more input and output variables.
            Manipulating one variable can affect one or more controlled variables or vice versa, requiring a more
            complex control system [2],[3],[4],[5],[6].</p>
        <p>A typical example is the case of a water-tube boiler that, by varying the fuel mixture or the water feed flow
            to the boiler, generates disturbances in the dome (height), increasing or decreasing steam production
            depending on the disturbance and being reflected in the internal pressure of the dome, which increases the
            risk of explosion and requires MIMO control systems. The control of these two manipulated variables
            (combustion mixture and water supply to the boiler) allows the boiler to be operated efficiently and safely,
            minimizing the risk of accidents. Therefore, simulation and process control through the use of software is
            one of the areas of greatest development due to its implications in the education and training of personnel
            [4],[7],[8],[9].</p>
        <p>The control of equipment associated with the operation of boilers is of vital importance as it is one of the
            fundamental industrial services for the performance of the chemical industry [2], [7], [9]. Due to its
            importance and complexity there are several ways to control the various variables of a boiler: Thus, Koppel
            et al use a method of decoupling controllers using the method of relative gains for interacting systems
            [10], He and Tan use an adaptive algorithm to calculate the parameters of a PID controller and make a
            comparison of the performance of the controllers [7], Pan et al use a genetic algorithm to optimize the
            performance of the controllers to variable loads in the control system [9]. On the other hand, Chen et al
            show a control strategy based on a third-order identification model for the optimization of a PID using the
            particle optimization methodology [2].</p>
        <p>The use of Nyquist and Bode diagrams is fundamental for the understanding.</p>
        <p>The present work deals with the solution of a 2x2 system for the modeling and simulation of a control system
            in the dome of a boiler using the Control Station software (LOOP PRO), where the technique of decoupling
            controllers is used to study the dynamics of the controllers and variables to be selected.</p>

        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Data collection from the boiler software. </p>

        <p>To find the dynamics of each of the variables in the boiler dome, the boiler software [11] was used to
            perform perturbations of different types (step, ramp, double pulse, etc.) in manual mode and collect the
            data for each one (Figure 1). The Desing Tool of the Control Station software was used to fit the data to a
            dynamic model of first order plus dead time or higher order plus dead time depending on its approximation.
        </p>



        <p class="subtitulo">Variable matching.</p>

        <p>With the functions fitted to a dynamic model, a 2x2 MIMO multivariable control strategy was proposed. Using
            the relative gain criterion, it was validated if the pairing of the variables is adequate and depending on
            the classification of the result (λ&gt;1, λ&lt;1, λ=1) we proceeded to follow with the decoupling
            methodology [10]. The variables proposed for the study are (Figures 1 and 2): manipulated, Inlet water mass
            flow (QF) and Fuel flow rate (QC); controlled, Dome water level (NW) and Steam outlet pressure (P). To
            complement the boiler dynamics, a disturbance variable was chosen: Steam outflow (QS).</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Tuning of the controllers.</p>

        <p>The controllers were tuned by the BLT method for multivariable systems, obtaining the initial parameters of
            each controller by the IMC method [3] for the main loops and thus, varying each parameter of the PI or PID
            controller until obtaining a Nichols plot, for each loop, that tangentially passes through the +2 dB curve.
            The parameters obtained by the BLT method were validated with the Nyquist stability criterion.</p>
        <p>After obtaining and validating the parameters of each controller by the BLT method, the 2x2 system was
            simulated in the Control Station software (Loop Pro) to obtain the performance of each controller in its
            loop and interaction. To optimize each controller, each controller parameter (KC, τI and τD) was modified
            (increasing and decreasing) and the response velocities in each loop to a step perturbation at the setpoint
            were observed. With the step figure, the values of rise time and overshoot, each parameter of the PID
            controller was retuned obtaining short response times, with little oscillation and minimizing the offset in
            each loop.</p>

            <img src="img/V25-N3-15/img2.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p class="subtitulo">Testing for servo and drive systems.</p>
        <p>With the parameters obtained in the tuning, double rectangular pulse type tests were performed for the servo
            and controller system. Ensuring that the dynamics in the boiler dome will not be affected by any change in
            any of its variables and that the controllers will respond quickly and efficiently keeping each variable at
            its desired value [12] [13][6].</p>
        <p class="subtitulo">Control strategies and model characterization</p>
        <p>The Control Station software interface (Figure 2) shows the strategy to simulate the automatic control of the
            process variables (NW - m3, P - Kpa) of a 2x2 multivariable system, from step, ramp, oscillatory or double
            rectangular pulse type changes in the setpoint of the manipulated variables (QF - Kg/s, QC - m3/s). Two
            interacting PID controllers are available to carry out the control of the 4 feedback loops described in the
            process, plus the perturbation (QS - Kg/s). In the case of the variable Nw, dome level, the volume of the
            system in m3 is specified for this case, which is given in % level.</p>
        <p>The Control Station software (LOOP_PRO) has a design tool for obtaining the transfer function of the process,
            from the data collection of the variables affected by the disturbance. It is a tool with a feasible approach
            that simplifies the calculations of complex processes such as those of a boiler. The software uses the
            method of adjustment by summation of the squared error and its adjustment index R2. In order to reduce the
            error by the approximation of the software method, a suitable type of perturbation was chosen for any order.
            Obtaining greater pressure with higher orders.</p>
        <p>One of the most practical and interesting applications of frequency response is the use of the pulse test to
            determine the transfer function of the process, instruments and other control devices [14][3][15]. The
            double rectangular pulse test is one of the most used in the industry for its flexibility in the execution
            time, flexibility that does not have the sinusoidal test, their execution times can be long or short
            depending on the influence of the manipulated variable on the controlled. It is accurate in higher order
            models and generates a complete Bode diagram. The only requirement of this test is to reach the initial
            steady state point [3].</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Obtaining the dynamics in the dome.</p>
        <p>The type of disturbance selected is the double rectangular pulse. In order to obtain the complete dynamics of
            the boiler dome, this test was performed for each manipulated variable to see its effect on each process
            variable and thus obtain its transfer function. This procedure was performed for direct processes,
            interactions and perturbations. As an example, the case of inflow (QF - Kg/s) - water volume (NW - m3) is
            taken (Figure 3). The transfer functions obtained by the Control Station software (Table 1) resemble the
            behavior of the boiler simulator; for this reason, they comply with the dynamics of a boiler dome with an
            approximation of R2 ranging from 0.9 to 0.99.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Each of the responses or changes shown in the controlled variables caused by the perturbations made to the
            manipulated or disturbance variables, show a typical behavior of the real process inside the dome of a
            boiler and its combustion, i.e., by increasing the feed flow, the liquid level in the dome increases which
            in turn decreases the pressure, and by decreasing its level also decreases and increases the pressure. By
            increasing the fuel flow, the pressure increases which in turn increases the level due to the increase in
            the size of the vapor bubbles (Expansion) and by decreasing it, the pressure decreases which in turn
            decreases the level due to the contraction phenomenon. By increasing the vapor outflow, there is a
            significant pressure drop and an increase in the liquid level due to its loss of pressure and mass.</p>


        <p class="subtitulo">Matching manipulated variables with controlled variables for each control loop</p>

        <p>To begin with, it makes sense that each controlled variable is controlled by the manipulated variable that
            exerts the most "influence" on it. In this sense, influence and gain have the same meaning and,
            consequently, in order to make a decision, all the gains of the steady state process (4 gains for a 2x2 MIMO
            system) must be found. Specifically, these gains are:</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-15/img5.jpg" height="150px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>K<sub>ij</sub>: gains of the process, where, i: is the controlled variable, j: is the</p>

        <div style="    display: flex;justify-content: space-evenly;">
            <div>
                <p>VC1: Variable Controlada 1 </p>
                <p>VC2: Variable Controlada 2 </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>VM1: Variable Manipulada 1 </p>
                <p>VM2: Variable Manipulada 2</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>The relative gain is calculated from the steady-state gains of the process and cross-loop interaction models,
            which best describe the dynamic behavior of the process.</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-15/img6.jpg" height="200px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>When the relative gain is between 0.5 and 1, the interaction of the loops causes every action of the
            controllers to be reflected and amplified in both process variables. This is not surprising since the
            relative gain is positive and close to one. One method of control choice would be to use decouplers for each
            control loop, or to tune each controller separately by doing a simple decoupling [16][3].</p>
        <p class="subtitulo">Tuning using the BTL (biggest log-modulus) method.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest questions in multivariable control is how to tune the controllers together with the
            interaction loop. If you have a PI controller, you have 2N (K<sub>c</sub>, τ<sub>I</sub>) parameters to
            select, if you have a PID,
            you have 3N (K <sub>c</sub>,τ<sub>I</sub>, τ<sub>D</sub>) parameters to select. BLT (Biggest Log-Modulus)
            has a standard tuning methodology.
            It meets the objective of arriving at a reasonable and optimal controller configuration with only a small
            amount of computation and computational help.</p>
        <p>The method is based on the classical Ziegler-Nichols SISO method. Using the Nichols plot the controller is
            tuned by passing the Nichols curve tangentially through its respective dB curve, for a SISO system it
            corresponds to the +2 dB curve, for a 2x2 MIMO system the +4 dB curve and for a 3x3 MIMO system by the
            +6 dB curve [17]. As the control strategy is a simple decoupling, the corresponding curve for its tuning is
            the
            +2 dB curve.</p>
        <p>To obtain the initial parameters, the IMC tuning method was used for each loop, taking into account only the
            direct process. Table 2 presents a summary of the proposed calculations.</p>

        <p>The main criterion of the BLT tuning method is to find the controller parameters that when plotting the open-
            loop transfer function tangentially pass through the +2dB curve. To find the controller parameters a factor
            was determined for each parameter (Kc, τI y τD)and with this to see its behavior in Nichols diagram. Figure
            4 and Table 3 show the influence of the proportional gain (Kc) in the Nichols diagram for the level
            controller (τI and τD values remain constant).</p>

        <p>Likewise, the influence of the integral time (τ<sub>I</sub>) in the Nichols chart for the level controller
            was analyzed,
            the values of K<sub>c</sub> =15.09 and τ<sub>D</sub> =0 (table 4 and figure 5). On the other hand, Table 5
            and Figure 6 show the

        <p>For its tuning, the criterion of decreasing τ<sub>I</sub> was taken to reduce the <i>rise time</i> as much as

            can be seen, the shorter the integral time, the greater the <i>overshoot</i>, to counteract this, the

        <p>Analysis and choice of the parameters of the level controller.</p>
        <p>As can be seen in Figure 11, B11 does not present overshoot and its time to reach its first setpoint (27.8%
            more) is 156 seconds, after the second change, it reaches its second setpoint (55.56% less) at 191 seconds.
            B12 has a very low overshoot (0.11%) that is corrected at 172 seconds, its time to the first setpoint is 95
            seconds and to the second is 197 seconds. B13 has a high overshoot (0.44%) that is corrected at 140 seconds,
            reaches the first setpoint at 59 seconds after the first change and reaches its second setpoint at 175
            seconds after the change.</p>
        <p>The final parameters of controller 1 (B11) are those of B12 where it has a very low overshoot (0.11%) and its
            response time is fast. Its reflection in the pressure control variable is not significant (0.75 Kpa). And
            its changes in the manipulated variable are smooth and gradual compared to the other 2 options.</p>

        <p>The BLT tuning and the tuning performed in Control Station were performed for changes in the setpoint of each
            controller (controller 1 - level and controller 2 - pressure) keeping the disturbance variable constant. But
            changes due to increase or decrease in steam demand is also a variable that affects the level in the dome
            and with greater influence the outlet pressure.</p>
        <p>Since a control system is rarely tuned for change in the setpoint and in turn for disturbance, the setpoint
            was left stable and the system was applied to a double rectangular pulse disturbance of magnitude 40 Kg / s
            to see the response of the controllers with the final parameters and all system variables.</p>
        <p>As can be seen in Figure 16, for a magnitude as high as 40 Kg/s, the controllers responded quickly, not
            allowing the level to increase by more than 1.06% and decrease by 2.22%. For the pressure, there was a
            decrease with respect to the setpoint of 0.01% and an increase of 0.02%. These changes were corrected in a
            matter of seconds, obtaining all variables in the desired state.</p>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>The final parameters of each controller are used for servo control and regulatory control in the 2x2 MIMO
            system, thus allowing a wide application in the operating conditions and minimizing the effects of each
            disturbance and its reflection in each variable.
        <p>The transfer functions obtained by the Control Station software, by means of double rectangular pulse type
            perturbations, have a high degree of approximation to the dynamics that normally occurs in the dome of a
            water-tube boiler obtained from the boiler software.</p>
        <p>The stability criteria applied (Nichols and Nyquist) allow verifying that the control loops simulated in
            automatic are stable.</p>
        <p>The pressure-controlled variable (P) responds faster and reaches its new setpoint in less time than the level
            controlled variable (NW).</p>

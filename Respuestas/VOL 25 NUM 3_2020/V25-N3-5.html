                    In the present work, steady-state simulations of the natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) and the postcombustion
            CO2 capture (PCC) processes have been modeled in the Aspen Plus® environment. The capture
            plan model was validated with data from the Colombian power plant "Termocentro" at 300MWe. A
            technoeconomical evaluation study has been performed for both a combined cycle (gas and steam) and the PCC
            process. The PCC process was based on the solvent 30% (w/w) MEA-H2O and on the solvent H2O-30%
            (w/w)-MEA-5% (w/w))-[Bmim][Bf4]. Sensitivity analysis was carried out, giving, as a result, an optimum
            concentration of 5% (w/w) for the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid ([Bmim]
            [BF4]) solvent. The study indicates how with efficient operation conditions of solvent regeneration, [Bmim]
            [Bf4] may be used for CO2 capture plans in the future.

                    En el presente trabajo, las simulaciones de estado estacionario del ciclo combinado de gas natural (NGCC)
                    y los procesos de captura de CO2 poscombustión (PCC) se han modelado en el entorno Aspen Plus®. El
                    modelo del plan de captura fue validado con datos de la central colombiana "Termocentro" a 300MWe. Se
                    ha realizado un estudio de evaluación tecno-económico tanto para un ciclo combinado (gas y vapor) como
                    para el proceso PCC. El proceso de PCC se basó en el disolvente 30% (p / p) MEA-H2O y en el disolvente
                    H2O-30% (p / p) -MEA-5% (p / p)) - [Bmim] [Bf4]. Se llevó a cabo un análisis de sensibilidad, dando como
                    resultado una concentración óptima del 5% (p / p) para el disolvente líquido iónico de tetrafluoroborato de
                    1-butil-3-metilimidazolio ([Bmim] [BF4]). El estudio indica cómo con condiciones de operación eficientes

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction </p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Background and motivations </p>

        <p>
            The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change considers that CO2 accounts for 65% of total greenhouse gas
            (GHG)
            emissions, being the focus of mitigation technologies for sequestration of CO2 (IPCC, 2014; Kijewska &
            Bluszcz,
            2016). The carbon capture and storage process, CCS (Araújo & de Medeiros, 2017) is a potential solution to
            climate
            change, which consists of the separation of CO2 from industrial and energy sources, its transport to a
            storage place,
            and its long-term atmosphere isolation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The PCC process is a considerably expensive process with high energy consumption, corrosion of equipment;
            degradation of the solvent - usually ammonia-based compounds - to potentially dangerous and toxic
            components,
            and low CO2 composition in the exhaust gas (10-16%) (L. Liu, Zhao, Deng, & An, 2016; Ramdin, De Loos, &
            Vlugt,
            2012). The aforementioned has prevented the massification of the technology at an industrial level and has
            led to
            exhaustive research in the exploration of solutions that reduce these negative factors (Leung, Caramanna, &
            MarotoValer, 2014).
        </p>


        <p>
            The use of an aqueous MEA solution in the CO2 absorption process is considered a mature technology
            (Abu-Zahra,
            Schneiders, Niederer, Feron, & Versteeg, 2007; Davis & Rochelle, 2009).Specifically, a solution of 30%MEA
            weight
            is used as a reference solvent for CO2 capture (Abu-Zahra et al., 2007). In a 600 MWe bituminous coal plant
            effluent
            gas using Aspen Plus®, to evaluate CO2 capture level, MEA concentration, CO2 lean solvent loading, operating
            regenerator’s pressure and temperature of the solvent, a significant impact on the solvent regeneration
            energy with a
            value of 3.9GJ/tonCO2 was found (Canepa & Wang, 2015). A capture plant scaled to process the stack gas from
            a
            427 MWe CCGT plant with data from a pilot plant showed the reliability of a rate-based model with multiple
            stages
            for a 250 MWe CCGT plant exhaust gas and the positive effect in the reduction of operational costs of the
            coal
            capture process (Luo & Wang, 2017).
        </p>

        <p>
            Los disolventes químicos de absorción, como las aminas, presentan problemas medioambientales además del
            alto riesgo de corrosión por los productos de degradación de las aminas y los gases ácidos húmedos [11].
            Desde
            1999, un grupo de disolventes llamados líquidos iónicos (IL) parece ser bastante prometedor como disolventes
            químicos ecológicos. Los IL presentan propiedades físicas versátiles debido a características como presión
            de vapor
            insignificante, excelentes propiedades dieléctricas, estabilidad térmica y plataforma sintonizable para el
            desarrollo
            de compuestos de captura de CO2 para el proceso de postcombustión (Hasib-ur-Rahman, Siaj, & Larachi, 2010;
            Janković et al., 2019; Krzemień, Więckol-Ryk, Smoliński, Koteras, & Więcław-Solny, 2016).The imidazolium
            based
            IL (5% [Bpy][BF4]-30% MEA) showed savings of 15% related to the regeneration energy on the stripper’s boiler
            (3.2GJ/tonCO2) compared to the conventional process. This promising value may be due to the absorber and
            stripper
            equilibrium model that may affect the uncertainty in the results, as well as inferiority with respect to
            using a ratebased model (Zhang et al., 2009). The results of the [Bpy][BF4]-MEA 30% system using a
            rate-based model at 5-30%
            IL showed a reduction of the specific boiler’s regeneration energy in the ranges 7-9% and 12-27%, compared
            with the
            30% on MEA conventional process (Zacchello, Oko, Wang, & Fethi, 2017). Specifically, the lowest found value
            was
            close to 4.13 GJ/ton CO2, which is 1.3 times higher than that found by (Huang, Zhang, Zhang, Dong, & Zhang,
            2014)
            when using the same system. (Ma et al., 2017) found that the energy consumption by using [Bmim][BF4] and
            [Bmim]
            [PF6] was reduced by 26.7% and 24.8% respectively, with respect to the process based solely MEA. The results
            were
            argued to the use of an equilibrium model and pure high-cost ILs by (Huang et al., 2014). (de Riva et al.,
            2017) studied
            8 ionic liquids in different configurations of packings in both columns, pressure and temperature; CAPEX and
            OPEX
            indices for the process were also calculated using a rate-based model [13]. Of the cases evaluated, the most
            optimal
            is obtained using the ionic liquid [emim][Ntf2] at a pure state, for which they report an OPEX value of 3.07
            M€/year
            and an OPEX of 1.59 M€/year for the absorption column, 3.6M€/year for the compression section and 1.63-4.08
            M€/
            year for the used IL at a price of 20 M€/kgIL. Finally, regeneration energy of 1.4GJ/tonCO2, which is the
            lowest value
            with respect to the previously mentioned works.
        </p>

            In this manuscript, we report the simulation of the PCC and NGCC processes of a Colombian electricity
            generation
            plant “Termocentro” using a rate-based model based on MEA and the ionic liquid [Bmim][BF4]. An analysis of
            Q,
            L/G as a function of either capture level, solvent loading, IL concentration was performed. Furthermore, an
            economic
            analysis of the NGCC and PCC processes, in terms of capital and manufacturing costs, and profitability
            analysis of
            the PCC process to analyze their economic feasibility throughout time, was done.

        <p class="subtitulo"> Simulation of the natural gas combined cycle (NGCC)
        </p>

        <p>The 300 MWe net NGCC thermoelectric power plant (TPW) "Termocentro" of ISAGEN’s company with a gas
            combined cycle (NGCC) plant was selected (ISAGEN, 2018). The TPW has two 1996 Westinghouse W501D5 gas
            turbines, with a 19 stages axial compressor and four expansion levels where the combustion of the natural
            gas and
            compressed air streams occurs.</p>




        <p>
            La energía de los gases de chimenea de las turbinas de gas fue utilizada por un generador de vapor de
            recuperación
            de calor (HRSG) para el ciclo de la turbina de vapor, formando el ciclo combinado y produciendo más
            electricidad.
            Las turbinas de vapor fueron fabricadas por General Electric, modelo 270T441 1996, con dos sistemas de
            presión
            (alta y baja) y flujo de vapor axial. Todas las turbinas están acopladas a generadores trifásicos con aire
            como medio
            de ventilación.
        </p>

        <p>
            The simulation of the Termocentro plant was achieved in Aspen Plus ® environment based on the average
            composition
            of the natural gas at different Colombian regions (Guerrero Suarez & Llano Camacho, 2003) (see Figure 1).
            Both
            "DESIGN SPEC" and "CALCULATOR" blocks were used to meet the specifications given by (ISAGEN, 2018). A
            net power output of 100MWe was specified both in each gas turbine by modifying the natural gas flow and a
            net
            power output of 100 MWe in each steam turbine was accomplished by varying the gas turbine efficiencies.
            Airflow
            varied until 15% in excess concerning the natural gas flow. Water flow was calculated to accomplish a gas
            outlet
            temperature in the range of 170-200°C. The gas turbine cooling airflow varied to maintain stack gases
            temperature
            at around 530°C.

            The Peng-Robinson equation of state (Peng & Robinson, 1976) with Boston-Mathias modification (PR-BM)
            (Mathias
            & Copeman, 1983) was used in the gas cycle, while the STEAMNBS method (Aspen plus®) in the steam cycle to
            predict the fluid properties in each section, depending on its nature.

        <p>
            In the pre-treatment section the stack gas is cooled in a direct contact cooler with water at 25 ° C to
            improve the absorption efficiency at 40 ° C and 1-1.5 bar (see Figure 2). Likewise, a blower was used to
            take into account the
            pressure losses that occur throughout the entire process.

            The stack gas leaving the pre-treatment section enters the absorber, (Figure 3) where 90% of the CO2 in it
            is absorbed
            when contacted counter-currently with the solvent and wherein the reaction occurs between CO2 and the MEA
            contained in the lean solvent. The CO2 rich solvent that leaves the absorber bottom is pressurized at 2 bar
            and
            heated to 107°C by passing through a pump and heat exchanger, respectively, before to the regenerator's
            intake. In
            the regenerator, the compounds formed in the absorber are released through the application of heat, emitting
            a CO2
            concentrated stream at the top and, from the bottoms, a regenerated solvent stream at a temperature of 125°C
            and 1.8
            bar. The regenerator’s top stream (CO2 >95% weight) is liquefied using compression to a pressure of 150 bar,
            so it can
            be easily transported to its final disposal; the solvent regenerated stream is recycled to the top of the
            absorber. The
            water and solvent make-up streams are introduced to overcome the losses that occur from their components in
            the top
            streams that leave the absorber and stripper.

            CO2 is mainly soluble in the MEA-H2O solvent through a series of chemical equilibrium reactions shown below.
            The

        <p class="subtitulo">Scale-up</p>

        <p>
            The CO2 capture plant needs to be scaled to meet the gas flow requirements of the 300MWe thermoelectric
            plant.
            This process is carried out maintaining the following constant:
        </p>

        <li>The capture level remains at 90%</li>
        <li>The solvent MEA concentration is 30%weight</li>
        <li>Operating pressures are 1 and 2 bar for the absorption and stripper columns, respectively</li>

        <p>
            The design of the absorption and stripper columns implies the use of an adequate pressure drop value of 42
            mm of
            water (Sinnot, 2005) thus an optimal gas-liquid distribution can be achieved. to estimate the columns
            diameters, as
            follows:
        </p>

        <p>
            The solvent flow (F <sub>Lean</sub>) through the columns was estimated by Equation 6 where the gas flow to
            be processed, gas
            density, liquid density, and viscosity are known values; likewise, a lean and rich solvent loading of 0.3
            and 0.5
            were assumed, respectively (Agbonghae, Hughes, Ingham, Ma, & Pourkashanian, 2014). Subsequently, the FLV
            flow
            parameter was calculated and k4, the modified gas load, is read from a pressure drop generalised correlation
            graph
            (Sinnot, 2005) assuming the mentioned pressure drop value Equation 7). Finally, the column cross sectional
            area is
            computed by Equation 8, where both the factor and length column’s packing are required.

        <p>
            The total equipment cost for the NGCC process was determined based on recognized vendors and literature data
            (DECARBit, 2011; DOE/NETL, 2007). For the PCC process, an economic technique, the cost module technique
            (CMT) was used. (Lemmens, 2016) found that the cost module technique presents deviations of -20% to +30% of
            the real cost. The CMT calculates the equipment cost in relation to their previous one on certain base
            conditions. In
            addition, deviation factors are introduced to take into account conditions different from standard ones.

            The model adequately predicts the experimental vapour-liquid equilibrium data (Figure 4). The highest RMSD
            was
            found for the CO2-MEA-H2O system data, with a greater deviation as the system temperature increases (Table

            decreasing its concentration. At this point, the temperature was adjusted to 40°C at the exit.

        <p>
            A reference model for the simulations of CO2 absorption plant for a binary MEA-H2O mixture as a solvent was
            taken from (Luo & Wang, 2017). The CO2 absorption model was simulated in Aspen Plus®, using a RADFRAC model
            based on mass and energy transfer rate correlations for the absorber and stripper columns. The results shown
            in Table
            10 confirm that the developed model adequately predicts the conditions of the CO2 capture process with
            respect to
            that reported by (Luo & Wang, 2017). The only parameter that was significantly underestimated was the
            solvent flow
            necessary to achieve 90% capture, which was 23.63% lower than reported.

        <p class="subtitulo">PCC: MEA e IL cases</p>

        <p>
            Next to the validation, the ISAGEN NGCC-thermoelectric plant stack gas was treated in the CO2 capture
            process
            for two cases: with an aqueous solution of 30% MEA and with an optimum concentration of 5% IL, 30% MEA and
            65 % water-the concentration of IL is justified in the sensitivity analysis of section 2.3.3, wherein is
            determined that
            this value requires the minimum amount of heat to regenerate the solvent-. The PCC process thermal and
            electrical
            requirements are found in Table 11. The thermal power for the PCC (IL) case decreased significantly respect
            to
            the case PCC (MEA) due to the lower regeneration energy required, while the electrical power, dependent on
            flow
            through equipment, varied only slightly. The regeneration energy decreased by 37.71% due to the lower IL
            enthalpy of
            absorption, compared with that of MEA (see Table 1). The compressors used to liquefy the CO2 represent the
            highest
            electrical power consumption, close to 72.62%. The power of this equipment, together with that of the pump
            and
            blower, represents a decrease in the net electric power once the NGCC and PCC processes are coupled.

            The set-out case results for CO2 capture process are summarized in Table 12. It is observed that is required
            4,279 GJ/
            tonCO2 of energy to achieve a capture level of 90%, which is a value in the range of those reported in the
            literature
            (e.g:(Canepa & Wang, 2015; Luo & Wang, 2017; Ma et al., 2017; Zacchello et al., 2017)), and it decreases to

            The results once the NGCC and PCC processes were coupled are shown in Table 13. This was achieved by the
            processing of the stack gas, the extraction of the steam heading the steam turbines in the first process,
            and its
            introduction to the stripper’s boiler

        <p>
            In this case, there is no distinction between PCC (MEA) and PCC (IL). Although the thermal energy in the
            second
            process decreases due to the ionic liquid presence, the solvent flow, which affects electrical equipment,
            does not vary
            appreciably and therefore little decreases the process overall electrical power. The net power decreased
            from 300 MW
            for the NGCC to 238.011 MW for the NGCC-PCC coupled process; a decrease of 20.66%. The efficiency decreased
            from 49.733% to 39.45%, in a respective manner. The avoided carbon dioxide cost was
            $82.77/tonCO<sub>2</sub>.

        <p>
            Figure 7.a shows that the solvent flow increased proportionally with the CO2 loading since the concentration
            of CO2
            in the liquid phase increases. On the other hand, the regeneration energy decreased with the increase of CO2
            loading.
            Figure 7.b indicates that an increase of MEA solvent concentration produced an increment of regeneration
            energy
            and a decrement of solvent flow. Figure 7.c shows that both the regeneration energy and the solvent flow
            increase as
            a higher capture level is specified. For example, the regeneration energy increases by 4% when going from a
            capture
            level of 80 to 95%. Similarly, the solvent flow rises 6.69% for the same change.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">IL case</p>

        <p>
            The sensitivity analysis was performed to analyze how the IL ([Bmim][BF4]) concentration in the solvent
            affected
            the regeneration energy and the solvent flow with a column reflux ratio constant throughout the entire
            concentration
            range, 30% (w/w) MEA and a CO2 loading of 0.3 mol/mol. In Figure 8 a decrement in both the regeneration
            energy
            and solvent flow over the entire concentration range was found. At 5% (w/w) IL the regeneration energy
            decreased by
            37.71% (from 4.66 to 2.9 GJ/tonneCO2) and the liquid flow over gas flow (L/G) decreased only 1.77%. However,
            the
            L/G decreased to 9.3% at 40 % (W/W) [Bmim][BF4]). Conversely, the regeneration energy increases after 5%IL
            due
            to the increase in sensible heat-an increment in the bottoms temperature that exceeds the decrease in
            solvent flow at
            the stripper.

            Subsequently, a concentration of 5% ionic liquid in the solvent (and 30% MEA) was selected as the optimum
            concentration and Q, L/G were analyzed as a function of CO2 loading. Figure 9 shows the variation of the
            regeneration
            energy (Q) and L/G at 30 % (w/w) MEA and 5 % (w/w) [Bmim][BF4]. Both the regeneration energy and the L/G

        <p>
            PCC (MEA): The choice of material and equipment types to be used was based on the considerations and
            recommendations on literature (IEAGHG, 2012). Stainless steel equipment was considered for MEA, a corrosive
            substance and carbon steel when the process fluid is water. The total equipment cost was 122.246 M$. The
            most
            expensive equipment was the absorber, which represents 46% of the total cost. The main process heat
            exchanger
            represents 20.42% of the total cost
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            PCC (ILs): For this case, the optimum concentration of 5 % IL, found in the technical section, was used to
            size the
            equipment. The equipment dimensions are affected mainly by the solvent flow throughout the process and this
            did not
            decrease significantly for the selected concentration. A slight corrosion of the equipment, due to the lower
            presence
            of MEA may be present
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Manufacturing cost</p>

        <p>
            The high-pressure steam represented 84% of the total utility cost for the MEA case. This is a clear
            confirmation
            that the CO2 regeneration energy in the stripper, measured in steam expenses, not only represents as a
            parameter
            the highest intensive energy consumption of the process, but the main process problem on the industry. For
            the IL
            [Bmim][BF4] case, the high-pressure steam represents 76.6% of the total utilities cost. However, the ionic
            liquid cost
            comes to represent an almost equivalent value.
        </p>

        <p>
            As noted, the PCC manufacturing process cost for [Bmim][BF4] increased 8.22% implying that the decrement of
            high-pressure steam was not enough to compensate the high cost of the IL. (see Table 15).
        </p>

        <p>
            On Figure 10 the solvent and the high-pressure steam costs as a function of the ionic liquid concentration
            is shown,
            in order to observe if the reduction in regeneration energy is worth the increment of the solvent cost
        </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-5/img27.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>
            It is observed that the steam cost was 37.71 % lower, the solvent cost 81.47% higher and the total cost
            (steam plus
            solvent) 17.67% higher at 5 % (w/w) [Bmim][BF4] when compared with only MEA in the solvent, meaning that,
            technically, a reduction of regeneration energy can be achieved by introducing an IL at expense of an
            economical
            infeasibility for the excessive increment in the solvent cost. This could be attributed to the IL cost
            assumed in this
            work ($40/kg IL).

        <p class="subtitulo">Profitability analysis
        </p>

        <p>
            In this section, an economic analysis of the NGCC process coupled to the PCC using as solvent H2O-30%(w/w)
            MEA
            and H2O-30%MEA-5%(w/w) IL was performed. The PCC case cannot be analyzed independently since, in this
            process, CO2 per se is not a defined value-added product. Therefore, the profitability analysis is carried
            out before
            and after coupling it to a PCC technology. This analysis is based on the completion of a non-discounted
            cumulative
            cash flow study. On Table 16 the conditions and/or assumptions for the profitability analysis are shown,
            which were
            taken from (Turton et al., 2009).
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            Figure 11 shows the cash flow along time for NGCC, NGCC-PCC(MEA) and NGCC-PCC (IL), suggesting that only
            for NGCC after 8.5 years (PBBP) the investment capital may be recovered with a net present value of 85.34M$
            at the
            end of the 20 year.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the NGCC and PCC processes were coupled, electricity generation revenues decrease while the capital and
            manufacturing costs of both processes are combined. This, of course, causes the company to have a negative
            cash
            flow in the entire analyzed time range. This is also observed in Figure 11.
        </p>

        <p>
            The analysis suggests that NGCC-PCC processes once coupled-either based on MEA or IL- were economically
            unfeasible, since the latter process causes a burden on capital and operational cost without any type of
            benefits on
            the first, more than the environmental one of avoiding the CO2 to be emitted to the atmosphere, with an
            additional
            revenue reduction in the first one by the lower net electricity produced.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, and despite the above mentioned, we proceeded to investigate how to increase the cash flow once the
            processes are coupled and obtain a net present value (NPV) equal to the isolated NGCC process. This is a
            rather
            complex optimization problem, which is beyond the scope of this paper, but it was done in a simplified
            manner by
            minimizing the square difference having as an objective function the accumulated cash flow at the end of
            year 20,
            adjusting the following parameters of the NGCC and PCC processes: capital cost (CGR), manufacturing cost
            (COMd)
            and revenues (R). The results are shown in Figure 12 and Table 20S.
        </p>

        <p>
            The results suggest that for the NGCC-PCC optimized process (MEA or IL), the CGR shall be reduced by 53.58%,
            from 534.49 to 248.069M$, since a relatively equal cost of equipment was assumed for both cases. In this
            sense the
            COMd shall be decreased 65.73% and 67.67% for NGCC-PCC (MEA) and NGCC-PCC (IL), respectively with a
            variation of R from 41.93 to 116.36M$ (63.97%) and 41.93 to 117.16M$ (64.65%), in a respective manner.

        </div>

        <p>
            These results are in agree with reports (Metz, Davidson, Coninck, Loos, & Mayer, 2005) that indicate that
            for the
            NGCC-PCC compound process, the generation of electricity must increase between a 10-40% with respect to a
            plant
            that does not have a CO2 capture system, which explains the increase of the R for the PCC process.

        <!-- Conclusiones -->
        <hr>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>
            In this work, the natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) process of the Colombian company ISAGEN and the carbon
            dioxide post-combustion capture process (PCC) were modeled in the Aspen Plus simulator. The feasibility of
            integrating the NGCC and PCC processes was analyzed through key parameters in the technical and economic
            studies carried out.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a result, it was estimated that the 300MW Termocentro thermo-electric generation plant, which operates
            with
            the natural gas combined cycle technology (NGCC), has a payback time (PBP) of approximately 9.5 years and a
            net
            present value (NPV) of 57M$ at the end of year 20 of the performed case study.
        </p>

        <p>
            The carbon dioxide capture plant once scaled to process the stack gas from the selected thermoelectric
            plant, has
            an L/G ratio of 1.6 and regeneration energy of 4.66GJ/tonneCO2 when 30% MEA is used as a solvent in the
            MEAH2O system; these values are within the ranges reported in the literature. Once the ionic liquid
            [Bmim][BF4] was
            introduced into the solvent, i.e. the IL-MEA-H2O system with concentrations of 5% IL and 30% MEA, the
            results
            obtained indicate that the regeneration energy decreases to 2.9GJ/tonneCO2 (37.71%) and the L/G ratio 1.8%.
            This
            significant decrease in energy represents fewer utility costs for the plant in terms of steam in the
            stripper, not being
            the case for pump powers or heat exchange areas, parameters that are affected by solvent flows, which
            changed
            only negligible. These results agree with similar works in literature, which predict that introducing ionic
            liquids is
            technically favorable for PCC technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Innovatively, this work studied the techno-economic viability of the implementation of ionic liquids in the
            capturing
            carbon dioxide process. The results show that neither the PCC process based on 30% MEA nor that based on
            ionic
            liquids at its optimum concentration of 5% are economically favorable if the PCC plant does not provide an
            additional
            economic benefit once it is coupled to the NGCC process
        </p>

        <p>
            To indicate a potential viability path for the PCC processes, an optimization problem was set out whose
            results
            suggest that for the PCC whether based on MEA or IL an extra income and a reduction in capital and
            manufacturing costs shall be achieved for the NGCC-PCC compound process to have a net present value at least
            equal to that of the
            independent NGCC process

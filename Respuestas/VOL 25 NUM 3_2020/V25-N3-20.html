                    Combustion is the main method of converting biomass to energy, either by direct heating systems or
                    by boilers. By means of CFD models, it is possible to optimize the behavior of those systems and
                    improve significantly its performance, without incurring the economic and environmental cost of
                    experimental studies. However, modelling of biomass combustion is a complex process that requires a
                    large number of sub-models and computational resources for a detailed description, therefore,
                    different approaches have been developed which depend on the system and simulation objective. In
                    this work, a review of the state of art of modelling of solid biomass combustion in the last years
                    is presented, including classification, description and analysis of several of the main models about
                    the subject.

                <p>
                    La combustión es el principal método de transformación de biomasa en energía, ya sea en sistemas de
                    calefacción directa o en calderas. Por medio de los modelos CFD se puede optimizar el funcionamiento
                    de estos sistemas y lograr mejoras significativas en su desempeño, sin incurrir en los costos
                    económicos y ambientales que los estudios experimentales acarrean. No obstante, el modelado de la
                    combustión de biomasa sólida es un proceso complejo que requiere de gran cantidad de sub- modelos y
                    recursos computacionales para una descripción detallada, por lo que se han desarrollado diversos
                    enfoques que dependen del sistema a modelar y del objetivo de la simulación. En el presente trabajo
                    se realiza una revisión del estado del arte sobre el modelado de la combustión de biomasa sólida en
                    los últimos años, incluyendo la clasificación, descripción y análisis de varios de los principales
                    modelos desarrollados sobre el tema.

        <!--Introducción-->
        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>
        <p>According to ISO 16559:2014, biomass can be defined as any material of biological origin, except those that
            have undergone mineralization processes such as those originating from oil, coal and natural gas [1]. It has
            several advantages when used as an energy source, such as: neutral CO2 emissions, energy independence in
            areas of difficult access and the possibility of using waste material [2].</p>

        <p>Therefore, several methods have been developed for its conversion into energy, of which combustion is the
            most widely used, either for direct heating or for use in boilers [3], [4]. This is a complex process
            composed of two physical stages of matter transfer and a chemical reaction stage [2], the first two stages
            correspond to: diffusion of the comburent through the gas phase and ashes to the unreacted zone, and
            diffusion in the opposite direction of the reaction gases; while the chemical reaction stage of combustion
            is divided into three phases: drying, pyrolysis and combustion of the carbonaceous residue. In drying, all
            the water in the fuel evaporates, it is an endothermic process that occurs when the fuel reaches 100 °C; in
            pyrolysis, the fuel decomposes into volatile gases, tar and carbonaceous components, in this stage the gases
            combust producing flame while the O2 pressure remains very low near the carbonaceous surface so that the
            latter does not combust; Finally, the combustion of the carbonaceous residue (char) occurs when the
            volatiles are oxidized and approximately 20% of the initial mass remains with approximately 90% porosity,
            the char contains high amounts of carbon so its calorific value is high, this is a much slower stage than
            the previous ones so it is the limiting of the overall chemical reaction. It is worth mentioning that during
            combustion not a single reaction occurs but a series of chain reactions, for example in the combustion of
            methane (CH4), the simplest of hydrocarbons, up to 40 elementary reactions are involved [5] that take place
            during the mentioned stages.</p>

        <p>Current combustion furnaces usually present problems of low efficiency, heat load instability and slag [6],
            [7], which represents a need for research to improve the performance of this equipment and in turn the
            reduction of pollutants, since the increase in efficiency leads to a significant decrease in emissions and
            fuel consumption; analyses have shown that a 1% increase in the efficiency of biomass-fired power plants
            leads to a 3% reduction in their CO2 emissions [4]. A valuable tool to improve the performance of biomass
            combustion systems is CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation, which can be used to improve the design
            and operating conditions of such systems without incurring the economic and environmental costs of
            experimental studies [8], [9]. However, the advantages of numerical methods in the optimization of biomass
            combustion are not fully exploited, because simulating it requires several sub-models for thermochemical
            conversion and sufficient computational resources [10] - [14]. A detailed description of the sub-models used
            in modeling solid biomass combustion is presented in the works of Dernbecher et al. [10], Karim and Naser
            [12], Bhuiyan et al. [4] and Khodaei et al. [15]. The aforementioned requirements make the modeling of solid
            biomass combustion a complicated process, to the point that the conversion, transport and reaction processes
            that take place there are not currently contemplated in commercial simulation tools [11], [13]. That is why
            several types of models and modeling approaches have been developed to satisfy different simulation
            requirements in different combustion systems. In the present work, a complete review of the state of the art
            on CFD modeling of solid biomass combustion is carried out, including the classification, description and
            analysis of several of the main models developed on the subject.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Classification of the models</p>

        <p>The combustion system hearth is usually divided into two zones according to the phase present: the solid zone
            or bed and the gaseous zone or freeboard. These can be modeled independently or together according to the
            complexity and objectives of the simulation, leading to the development of different types of models for
            different systems and conditions. The classification of solid biomass combustion models varies slightly
            according to the author consulted. A widely accepted classification is presented by Karim and Naser [12],
            who categorize the models according to the way the energy equation is calculated, as shown in Table I.</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-20/img1.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>According to Yang et al. [16] the models can be categorized into "thermally thick" or "thermally thin"
            according to the value of the Biot number in the bed, in the first case (Bi>>1) large temperature gradients
            are reached within the particles leading to superposition of the combustion stages (drying, pyrolysis and
            char combustion) and in the second case (Bi &lt; 2) the intra-particle effects are neglected and the stages
            are
            assumed to occur consecutively throughout the particle.</p>
        <p>Dernbecher et al [10] classify the models, according to the approach used for the treatment of
            boundary conditions, into four categories: empirical, separated bed, porous zone and discrete
            particle. These are described below.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Empirical Approach</p>

        <p>This approach consists of simulating the freeboard taking into account the input of gases from the
            bed without the need for coupling with a solid phase combustion model, the bed is usually divided
            into four sections corresponding to the three stages of combustion (drying, pyrolysis and combustion
            of the carbonaceous phase) and the remaining ashes, and the profiles of temperature, mass flow and
            concentration of gaseous species are determined entirely experimentally or are calculated from the
            elemental composition of the biomass. In the first case, pyrolysis experiments are performed to
            determine the volatiles released from the fuel at a certain temperature; the conditions of these
            experiments differ from the conditions during combustion, since they are carried out at low
            temperatures and the presence of oxygen is neglected [17]. In the second case, calculations based on
            experimental data are used to give information about combustible gases, which some authors call the
            semi-empirical approach. The empirical approach is easy to implement and represents low
            computational effort so, when one wants to simulate an already measured system, it can be the best
            approach [10]; however it is not flexible to changes making it have low capacity to predict
            combustion in the design phase [15]. One type of application for this approach is the improvement of
            combustor designs for certain operating conditions in an existing combustion system [10].
            Flexibility improves when working with semi-empirical models, however they need specific data that
            must be assumed if they are not known, which affects their predictive capability.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Separate bed or "Stand Alone" approach</p>

        <p>In this approach, independent models are used for the bed and the freeboard, which are coupled in one
            or two directions. Generally, the simulation of the gas phase is performed by means of a commercial
            CFD code, while for the solid phase an independent model is developed where drying, pyrolysis and
            char consumption in the bed are simulated. This is the most widely used approach, by means of which
            zero- dimensional, one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional models have been
            developed, although this last type is rare, generally the three-dimensional models are developed
            under the porous zone approach. These are more flexible models than the empirical ones and represent
            a low computational consumption, they are mainly used in systems with bulk fuel bed and continuous
            operation such as pellet boilers or systems with moving grate [10].</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Porous zone approach</p>

        <p>It is the evolution of the separated bed approach, the bed is modeled as a porous medium, which
            allows air to flow through it, considering heat and mass exchange between the gas and solid phases.
            The necessary parameters for the properties of the porous medium are taken from measurements. The
            bed and freeboard are simulated in the same domain. This is the approach used by several commercial
            software, in which case it is necessary to use user-defined functions (UDF) to jointly solve the bed
            and freeboard due to the complexity of the thermal conversion in the solid phase. This approach is
            more reliable than the previous ones in terms of bed independence and extensibility, however it is
            more complicated and requires more computational time.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Discrete Particle Method (DPM) Approach</p>

        <p>In this approach the biomass particles are represented by Lagrangian particles whose trajectory is
            calculated based on the forces applied to them. The thermo-chemical conversion of each fuel particle
            is calculated individually. It is an approach that allows a detailed description of the fuel
            particles in the bed model, however computationally expensive. It is used to simulate fuel beds with
            bulk material such as wood chips or pellets.</p>

        <p>Table 2 presents several of the most relevant works on solid biomass combustion modeling developed in
            the last 20 years, where their classification according to the mentioned approaches, the type of
            system and biomass for which they were developed, the parameters obtained from the simulation and
            the software used to support it are shown. As can be seen, the four approaches have been
            successfully used in recent years, which indicates that all four remain valid; the selection of the
            approach to be used depends on the objective of the simulation and the system to be modeled. In most
            of the works, commercial software is used, which is used to model the gas phase of the hearth
            (freeboard) and sometimes the bed; in the latter case, the use of UDFs is necessary to expand the
            CFD capacity. It can also be observed that, generally, simulation is used to obtain temperatures,
            flow velocities and process emissions, this is due to the fact that the performance of the system is
            studied at different conditions and these values allow determining indicators for this purpose. The
            performance of a packed bed boiler can be determined by means of thermal conversion efficiency and
            emissions, the former expressed through the burn rate, ignition velocity, peak temperature and
            thickness of the reaction zone; while the latter is constituted by particulate (soot, organic
            particles and ash particles) and gaseous (H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, NOx and other hydrocarbons) emissions
            [15].</p>

        <p>In Colombia, few works have been presented on the subject, which simulate the combustion of sugar
            cane bagasse. For example, the works of Mendieta and Sanchez [18], Guevara [19], Diaz et al. [20]
            and Correa [21], in the first two, combustion was simulated in Ward-Cimpa combustion chambers used
            in the production of panela, in the first a one-dimensional mathematical model was used and in the
            second a two- dimensional model, in the remaining works an industrial boiler was simulated, dividing
            it into three parts: primary air circuit, secondary air circuit and the furnace. Further details of
            these works are presented in Table II.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Main applications of the full simulation models</p>

        <p>The comprehensive simulation models are those that focus on simulating the complete combustion system
            and not only in a sub-process of combustion, they usually use global reaction schemes with few
            reactions to reduce the computational cost. They are models that have been mainly used to simulate
            combustion in: mobile grate systems, pellet boilers, wood stoves and straw bales [10]. A brief
            description of each is presented below.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Mobile grid systems</p>

        <p>Combustion system fireplaces can be classified into static and dynamic, within the latter are the
            mobile grate fireplaces [2], which are the most used for combustion at industrial level [15];
            covering a wide range of powers, ranging from 240 kW to 108 MW. For this reason most of the
            publications on biomass combustion modeling are related to this application. The models are
            generally developed under the empirical, two-dimensional separated bed and discrete particle
            approaches, aiming to predict hearth temperatures and emissions of NOx, CO, ash and other
            pollutants. The most commonly used fuels have been: municipal solid waste, wood chips and straw
            [10].</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Pellet boilers</p>

        <p>Static-fired pellet boilers (fixed grate) are widely used in small to medium scale applications,
            ranging from 8 to 250 kW [10]. There are similarities between small scale and industrial scale
            combustion because of the small horizontal gradients, which means that small scale boilers are often
            used to understand the process carried out in moving bed boilers [15]. The most commonly applied
            approaches for CFD simulation of these systems are the empirical and porous zone approaches.</p>

        <p>Mobile grate boilers are the most widely used industrially [15], however, low-power fixed-bed boilers have
            gained popularity in recent years due to their simplicity, low operating cost and low requirements in terms
            of fuel preparation and transportation [15], [41], [49]. This is an advantage for developing countries
            because this type of boilers, fueled by local waste, can be used for power generation in remote areas [50],
            [51], while in industrialized countries their benefit is observed in both district heating and electricity
            supply [52]. The European market for small-scale power plants below 20 MWth is expected to grow by 100% in
            the next decade and growth rates are expected to be high worldwide [44]. Although this technology is well
            developed, improvements in low power biomass boilers are required to reduce their pollutant emissions and
            increase their efficiency [41], [45], [53], [54].</p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Wood-burning stoves</p>

        <p>With a power of about 32 kW, they are mainly used for domestic heating [10]. The following approaches are
            generally used to model them: empirical, one-dimensional separated bed and porous zone.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Straw bales</p>

        <p>This application is the least common of all, mainly the empirical and porous zone approaches have been used.

        <p class="titulo">Conclusions</p>

        <p>A review of the state of the art of CFD modeling of solid biomass combustion in the last 20 years worldwide
            was conducted, presenting the approach, objectives and application of several relevant models from the
            mentioned period.</p>

        <p>A review of the state of the art of CFD modeling of solid biomass combustion in the last 20 years worldwide
            was performed, presenting the approach, objectives and application of several relevant models of the
            mentioned period.</p>

        <p>Solid biomass combustion modeling is a complex process due to the large number of sub-models and
            computational resources it demands. In the vast majority of the works, commercial CFD software is used to
            simulate the hearth freeboard, while the bed requires the implementation of user-defined functions because
            commercial software does not have the capability to simulate it independently.</p>
        <p>Combustion models can be classified, according to the way the energy equation is calculated, into homogeneous
            and heterogeneous, of which the former have not presented good results because they assume the same
            temperature for the two hearth phases, which is why the current models are developed from the second point
            of view. Regarding the modeling approach, the models can be empirical, separate bed, porous zone or discrete
            particle models, which are used according to the objectives and system to be modeled. The separated bed
            approach has been the most widely used because of its flexibility and relatively low computational cost.</p>

        <p>The main applications for combustion models are: mobile grate systems, pellet boilers, wood stoves and straw
            bales; of which the first one is the most studied because it is the most related to industrial systems. The
            empirical approach has been used in all applications because it is the easiest to implement and requires
            less computational effort.</p>

        <p>Few articles have been published in Colombia on the subject, which have focused on the combustion of sugar
            cane bagasse.</p>

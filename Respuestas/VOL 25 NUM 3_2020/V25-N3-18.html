        <!--Introducción-->
        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>

        <p>As a consequence of accelerated growth and insufficient territorial planning in some cities, many urban
            developments are built on land where topographic, geological and geotechnical conditions are not appropriate
            for supporting structures and infrastructure. In these scenarios, stresses and deformations in soil and rock
            masses are usually close to the admissible limit values, and anthropic processes during and after the
            execution of urbanization projects modify the equilibrium of the terrain and increase the risk of
            instability.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Risk due to terrain instability</p>

        <p>This risk is defined as the probability of loss and damage to physical property and people, due to the
            occurrence of terrain instability phenomena that depend, to a large extent, on the geomorphological and
            geological-geotechnical conditions of the site; and the modification of these by geodynamic processes, land
            use, human activities, etc. [1-2]. Mathematically, risk is a function of hazard, understood as the
            probability of the occurrence of potentially destructive instability events; and vulnerability, defined as
            the degree of loss or damage that could occur in the exposed elements, if the threatening event were to
            occur [3].</p>

        <p>Successful risk estimation depends on the analysis and assessment stages being properly carried out [4]. The
            analysis consists of estimating the risk by quantifying the hazard and vulnerability, using all available
            information on the study area. While, in the assessment, it is determined whether the existing risk is
            acceptable (or not) and decisions are made on the control and mitigation measures to be implemented [5].</p>

        <p>There are various methods and procedures for analyzing and assessing risk, but, in general, they can be
            grouped into three categories: qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative [6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14]. The
            first ones describe the risk in terms of high, moderate and low; while the quantitative methods express the
            quantity, cost and number of goods and people that could suffer damage or loss.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Urbanization vs. terrain instability</p>

        <p>Many cities that have undergone accelerated and chaotic urbanization processes are located in mountainous
            areas where valleys and plains have been occupied by urban sprawl; and the areas available for new
            development present very complex topographic, geological and geotechnical conditions. In these cases, the
            analysis and evaluation of the risk of terrain instability is fundamental for making decisions on the
            feasibility of urbanization projects.</p>

        <p>These projects are characterized by the generation of economic, financial, environmental, social and
            technical risks, which must be considered in the economic and financial structuring of their different
            stages. Soil instability is included among the technical risks that should be analyzed and evaluated at the
            study stage [15].</p>

        <p>Urbanization and land instability in Tijuana: In Mexico, the increase in urbanization processes generated new
            patterns of population distribution and economic activities in certain territories called urban regions,
            among which the Northwest urban region, led by the metropolitan area of Tijuana, stands out for its growth
            and development [16].</p>

        <p>This area has been characterized by an accelerated and chaotic expansion, with territorial growth rates of up
            to 3.5 hectares/day and population growth rates of over 6% per year [17]. By the 1970s, the urban sprawl had
            occupied practically all of the plains of the Tijuana River and the Alamar stream, and began to advance
            towards areas of hillsides characterized by the presence of ravines, canyons and steep slopes (Figure 1).

        </div>

        <p>Currently, there are very few areas available with good conditions for building urban works, so most
            urbanization
            projects are developed in hilly and geologically complex terrain, where instability phenomena are a constant
            danger. Consequently, the number and frequency of destructive events in urban developments built on
            hillsides has increased (Figure 2).</p>

        <!-- Metodología y materiales -->
        <hr>

        <p class="titulo">Materials and methods
        </p>

        <p>This article describes and applies a procedure to analyze and evaluate the risk due to terrain instability,
            based on the characterization of the physical environment; it estimates the hazard based on the
            susceptibility and probability of occurrence of different phenomena; and determines the vulnerability
            considering characteristics and costs of the exposed threatened elements [1].</p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Description of the procedure</p>

        <p>The procedure used is a quantitative method and consists of the following stages:</p>

        <li type="I">Investigation and characterization of the study area</li>

        <p>Studies are carried out to identify conditioning and triggering factors of instability [18], to elaborate the
            geological- geotechnical models used to estimate and quantify the hazard, and to characterize the elements
            exposed to damage. Studies of: topography and geomorphology; geology and geotechnics; tectonics and seismic
            activity; hydrology and hydrogeology; vegetation; erosion and scour; and anthropic processes and human
            activity are recommended.</p>

        <li type="I">Investigation and characterization of the study area</li>

        <p>They are carried out based on the susceptibility and probability of occurrence of instability events. Threat
            is determined through equation (1):</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-18/img3.jpg" height="100px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Where:</p>

        <p><i>Hi</i> is the hazard of an event of intensity i, at time t.</p>

        <p><i>S</i> is the susceptibility of the terrain to instability</p>

        <p><i>P</i> is the probability of occurrence of the event</p>

        <p>It is proposed to determine the susceptibility using the following methods: a) Method of valuation factors
            for mass
            movements [7]; b) Expert criteria for other instability phenomena.</p>

        <p>The probability of occurrence of instability events is estimated by deterministic methods that allow
            obtaining potential rupture surfaces, safety factors and displacements.</p>

        <li type="I">Analysis and assessment of the vulnerability of exposed elements</li>

        <p>It is performed following the following stages: identification, location and characterization of the exposed
            elements; evaluation of the expected types of damage and; calculation of vulnerability using equation (2)
            [6-10].</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-18/img4.jpg" height="200px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Where:</p>

        <p>V is the vulnerability of the element exposed to the </p>
        <p>hazard. I is the intensity of the event</p>
        <p>F is the fragility of the exposed element</p>

        <li type="I">Risk analysis and evaluation</li>

        <p>The specific risk is calculated using equation (3).</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-18/img5.jpg" height="150px" width="auto">
        </div>
        <p>Where:</p>

        <p>Rs is the specific risk, which expresses the degree of expected losses due to the materialization of the
            hazard of
            intensity i.</p>

        <p><i>Hi</i> is the hazard of intensity i</p>
        <p><i>V</i> is the vulnerability of the elements exposed to the hazard, expressed on a scale between 0 and 1.
        </p>
        <p><i>C</i> is the quantification of the exposed elements. In economic terms, it is the cost of the elements
            threatened.</p>

        <p>Losses in physical assets are evaluated through the approximate cost of damage, as a percentage of the
            commercial value of the exposed elements, obtained considering the value of the actions to restore normality
            in the affected area. The approximate cost of damage makes it possible to categorize the risk, evaluate its
            acceptability and determine actions for its control and mitigation (Table 1).</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Case Study</p>

        <p>The described procedure was applied in an urbanization project planned to be developed in the metropolitan
            area of Tijuana.</p>

        <li>Description of the project site</li>

        <p>The study area is located in the so-called southwestern elongated sierras, and occupies an area of
            approximately 24
            hectares, of lomerío relief, with heights of up to 275 meters and slopes of more than 35% (Table 2, Figure
            3).</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-18/img7.jpg" height="300px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Two lithological units predominate in the site, in which there are soils consisting of coarse alluvium,
            conglomerates,
            sandstones with scattered boleos, slope deposits, and tuffs with clayey and sandy facies in most of the
            area.</p>

        <p>Before requesting the study described in this article, the company responsible for the project carried out
            earthworks (cut and fill) in the area to form six platforms that will house lots for single-family homes,
            apartment buildings, a school and stores, as well as the embankments that will serve as the base for the
            main road connecting the platforms
            and the secondary roads inside the lots.</p>

        <!--         Results and Discussion -->
        <hr>
        <p class="titulo"> Results and Discussion</p>

        <p>The results of the analysis and evaluation of the risk of ground instability in the existing platforms and
            embankments are presented.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Investigation and characterization of the study area</p>

        <p>Geological, geophysical, hydrological and geotechnical studies carried out in the area were reviewed and
            interpreted in order to characterize the physical environment in the study area. In addition, reports and
            technical reports of nine ground instability events that occurred in nearby areas with similar geotechnical
            characteristics were studied.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Hazard analysis and evaluation</p>

        <p>It was carried out considering the probability of occurrence of ground instability phenomena, as well as the
            susceptibility of the terrain to their occurrence.</p>

        <li>Terrain stability analysis</li>

        <p>The topographic profiles shown in Figure 4 were used, and methods based on limit equilibrium of potentially
            unstable land masses, as well as stress-strain analysis [19-20].</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-18/img9.jpg" height="600px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Table 3 presents the results of the analysis performed using methods based on limit equilibrium.</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-18/img10.jpg" height="550px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Figure 5 shows the failure mechanisms corresponding to the minimum safety factors.</p>

        <p>Figure 6 shows the behavior of horizontal and vertical displacements, which are estimated to occur in the
            terrain
            around the profiles with the highest probability of instability.</p>

        <p>These movements could be unacceptable for the structures and infrastructures to be built.</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-18/img11.jpg" height="700px" width="auto">

        </div>

        <p>The calculated factors of safety, the depths of the rupture surfaces and the estimated displacements indicate
            that there
            is a high probability of occurrence of potentially destructive instability phenomena in the vicinity of
            profiles A and B.</p>

        <li> Susceptibility analysis</li>

        <p>The influence of the instability conditioning and triggering factors identified in the study area was
            evaluated (Table 4).</p>

        <p>It was performed following the following stages [5]: identification and zoning of exposed elements (Figure
            8); characterization; expected damage analysis (Table 7); and vulnerability calculation.</p>

        <li> Vulnerability calculation </li>

        <p>It was made based on the intensity (I) of the threatening movements and the fragility (F) of the exposed
            elements, according to equation (2) (see Table 8).</p>

        <p>The intensity was obtained considering that the potentially unstable terrain can move at a speed of up to
            3.22 m/day, estimated from the results of monitoring landslides that have occurred in nearby areas, with
            conditions similar to the study area.</p>

        <p>This was carried out considering the hazard, vulnerability, and the value of the exposed elements (Tables 9

        <p class="titulo">Discussion </p>

        <p>In the field of urbanization projects, the risk of ground instability refers to the probability of damage or
            loss to urban structures and infrastructure that are planned to be developed, due to the occurrence of
            phenomena such as subsidence, settlement and mass movements of soil and rock. In areas of rugged relief and
            complex geological- geotechnical conditions, the analysis and evaluation of these risks at the study stage
            is an essential tool for making decisions on the feasibility and viability of projects.</p>

        <p>In the metropolitan area of Tijuana, land with good conditions for urban development is very scarce, and new
            projects must adapt to scenarios that require major transformations in the physical environment, which alter
            the equilibrium of the terrain and considerably increase the risk of instability.</p>

        <p>The risk analysis and evaluation in the case study presented not only validated the procedure described, but
            also identified the sectors most likely to be affected by instability phenomena, estimated the damages that
            could occur and their costs, categorized the risk, evaluated its acceptability and proposed measures for its
            control and mitigation.</p>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>Ground instability may be the cause of failure of urbanization projects in areas of rugged topography and
            complex geological-geotechnical conditions, if the analysis and evaluation of this risk is not considered in
            the feasibility studies.</p>

        <p>The analysis and evaluation of the risk due to terrain instability, carried out in the project to be
            developed in Tijuana, made it possible to quantify the threat of potentially destructive phenomena and the
            vulnerability of the elements exposed to be affected, identify the areas with a high probability of
            suffering damage, and estimate the approximate cost of the damage. With these results, the risk was
            categorized and actions for its reduction were proposed.</p>

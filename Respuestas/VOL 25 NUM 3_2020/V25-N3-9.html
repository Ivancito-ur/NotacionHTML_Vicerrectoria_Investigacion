                    Throughout this study, we propose using hybrid heating (microwaves – thermal radiation) on a heterogeneous
            structure. Our goal is to improve the effectivity of its thermal treatment. We analyze a core-shell assembly
            with different thermal and electrical properties. A solid sphere makes up the core of the arrangement. Such
            a core is surrounded by three layers of different materials. Because of the properties of the original
            system, we propose modifying the core so that it absorbs microwaves. The layers are all homogeneous and
            microwave transparent. The first two exhibit a low thermal conductivity, while the outermost one is a good
            thermal conductor. We also propose adding a thin layer of susceptor between the first two layers, striving
            to alleviate the low thermal conduction problem. Furthermore, the dielectric loss constant of this new layer
            is temperature-dependent. We assume that the composed sphere hangs within the electromagnetic cavity and
            continuously rotates, so it homogeneously receives microwaves and thermal radiation (from an electrical
            resistance). Thus, the thermal model is given by a set of time-dependent partial differential equations.
            Transient temperature profiles are analyzed under different experimental scenarios. There is a clear
            advantage of using the proposed hybrid heating in this particular case.

            capas son todas homogéneas y transparentes a las microondas. Las dos primeras presentan una baja

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction
        <p>

        <p>The application of microwave-based thermal treatment in processes such as chemical reactions have spread the
            word about such a technique. Among its advantages reside unique features, such as a lowered electrical
            energy consumption and a fast and controlled heating. This, in turn, allows reducing processing times and
            energy costs, as well as improving physico-mechanical properties. All of this favors the economy of the
            process [1] - [4]. Despite its advantages, real application of microwave heating is sometimes limited. This
            is especially true when certain surface properties are required, which can only be achieved through
            traditional heating (convection or thermal radiation). Likewise, it is also not appropriate to use microwave
            heating for all materials and processes. The reason: The process may become unfeasible from an economic
            point of view.</p>
        <p>Microwave processing is favored when the material to be heated exhibits a high complex permittivity (real,
            ϵ', and imaginary, ϵ'', components). These parameters are, in general, temperature and frequency dependent.
            Such is the case for BaTiO3 and SiC. Hence, it becomes necessary to determine them experimentally. One way
            of doing so is through the coaxial transmission line (CTL) or the cavity perturbation methods, using a
            network analyzer [5], [6]. There is also a dependency regarding variables such as sample geometry, porosity
            and size, as well as the change in their properties and the presence of volatiles, among others. Because of
            this, it becomes paramount to follow a careful analysis of the experimental data, especially when validating
            a mathematical model [6] - [9]. It is due to the aforementioned difficulties that hybrid heating represents
            a handsome alternative. Such a treatment seeks to combine the best of both worlds. Literature reports quite
            a variety of hybrid heating applications, such as in reactors and ferroelectric synthesis, among others
            [10]- [13]. One way of doing hybrid heating is to combine microwaves with thermal radiation. In this work,
            we simulate such a scenario, assuming that thermal radiation comes from an electrical resistance. Here, we
            seek to determine whether this approach is feasible for the selected heterogeneous system.</p>
        <p>The system selected for treatment in this work is given by a core-shell structure, with four regions of quite
            different thermal conductivities and dielectric losses. The thermal treatment consists on keeping
            temperature between 370 and 410°C. We opted for modifying the core, mixing it with a nano-susceptor (15%
            w/w). This makes it possible for the core to absorb microwaves, and provides a high thermal conductivity.
            Moreover, the first layer has a low thermal conductivity. Also, because of problem restrictions, it cannot
            be mixed with a susceptor. Therefore, we opted for coating it (thus creating a new thin layer) with
            susceptor and at a maximum thickness of 0.5 cm. Such a layer also has a dielectric loss factor (ε^'' (T))
            that changes linearly with temperature. Hence, its internal energy generation is affected. For the next
            layer, the problem restricts it from being mixed or coated and it has a low thermal conductivity. The
            outermost layer was also not altered. The proposed hybrid heating system is given by a magnetron that feeds
            a traditional microwave cavity. Thermal radiation is supplied by an electrical resistance located within the
            cavity. The resulting mathematical model comes from a global energy balance and it is given by a set of
            coupled partial differential equations. The model was articulated with one for volumetric heat generation
            derived from Maxwell equations. The complete model was solved through finite element analysis in MATLAB. In
            the end, transient temperature profiles were generated. We also generated gradients in all directions as a
            function of time for some limit scenarios. This allowed us to analyze how effective this strategy actually
            was.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Thermal model</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">The 3D thermal problem</p>

        <p>The final thermal system is composed by a solid internal sphere and four concentric layers. Since such a
            modified sphere has constant electrical properties (𝜀′; 𝜀′′; 𝑡𝑎𝑛(𝛿)), it can absorb energy transported
            by an incident electromagnetic field. For this work, the field is equivalent to microwaves. Layers one and
            three exhibit a low thermal conductivity, thus inhibiting a homogeneous processing. Nonetheless, the added
            layer (number two) absorbs microwaves and has a high thermal conductivity. The external layer (number four)
            also is a good thermal conductor. For this work, we assume that contact resistances between layers are
            negligible. Moreover, we assume that thermophysical properties are time, position, and temperature
            invariant. Additionally, the sphere is assumed to hover within the electromagnetic cavity and slowly
            rotates. A mode stirrer is included in the cavity. Hence, the sphere receives uniform radiation from both,
            microwaves and electrical resistance, on both hemispheres.</p>



        <p class="subtitulo">Thermal model within the system</p>

        <p>Heat conduction throughout the core-shell system, while it is being subjected to hybrid heating, is analyzed.
            The heating system is composed by a microwave generator and an electrical resistance that heats the
            outermost layer. The mathematical model describing heat conduction is given by a set of five coupled time-
            variable partial differential equations, in spherical coordinates. Thermal conductivities and dielectric
            loss factors are temperature independent. The solution of the mathematical model allows generation of
            temperature profiles as a function of position (3D) and time, for each of the four layers, as well as for
            the solid sphere. The model is given by the energy balance (also known as heat diffusion equation) shown in
            (1), which is valid for: 𝑟𝑖 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 𝑟𝑖+1, with 𝑖 = 1,2,3,4,5.</p>

        <p>Conditions 3 and 4 belong to the 𝜃 direction, while 5 and 6 belong to 𝜙. In this case, internal energy
            generation (i.e. volumetric heat generation) exists for the core (𝑖 = 1) and for layer two (𝑖 = 3). This
            is assumed to be constant with time and position. Here, we will model it as a constant energy flow,
            transported by electromagnetic waves and exclusively absorbed by nano-susceptors with constant complex
            permittivity. Other components of the system are described further on.</p>

        <p>The model will be solved under the consideration that thermodynamic properties of the system are position
            independent (homogeneous isotropic media). Regarding boundary conditions and internal generation, we shall
            assume them as time independent. We also consider that no component evaporates and that there are no
            chemical reactions.</p>



        <p class="subtitulo">Equations modeling microwave interaction</p>

        <p>Power transported by electromagnetic waves and absorbed by the system can be described in (11), (12) y (13),
            and are known as the three independent Maxwell equations,</p>

        <p>It is evident that electric and magnetic fields must simultaneously exist within the cavity, as they
            interact. Likewise, constitutive equations are required 𝐷 = 𝜀𝐸 ; 𝐵 = 𝜇𝐻 and 𝐽 = 𝜎𝐸. Complex
            permittivity of a material is given by (14),</p>

        <div class="image">

        <p>Both parameters are temperature and frequency dependent, for most materials. Hence, they are paramount when
            studying electromagnetic wave penetration and its conversion to thermal energy (heat). Two of the most
            relevant parameters in microwave-based thermal treatment are: the imaginary part of complex permittivity,
            also known as dielectric loss constant (𝜀′′); and the loss tangent (𝑡𝑎𝑛 𝛿 = 𝜀′′/𝜀′). The latter
            represents the ability of a material for converting microwaves into heat. A material with high 𝑡𝑎𝑛 𝛿 and
            𝜀′′ will be easier to heat than other with lower values. Higher 𝜀′ values indicate a higher wave
            penetration. Also, high 𝜀′′ values are linked to a high conversion of energy into heat.</p>


        <p class="subtitulo-segundo">Power generated by microwaves</p>

        <p>Microwave heating implies direct conversion of electromagnetic energy into heat. Integrating the Poynting
            vector (𝑆) yields the power flow through a closed surface, indicated in (15).</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Procedure</p>

        <p>We begin by showing experiments with the original system (i.e. with no added layer nor modified sphere). This
            is done to grasp an idea about the thermal problem. Afterwards, simulations considering only the electrical
            resistance are presented. We verify that temperature profiles be symmetric, since the system rotates. We
            then move on to simulate the effect of having only microwave-based heating. This should generate an inverse
            temperature profile, meaning that the geometric center of the system will be the hottest point. Finally, we
            analyze the effect of hybrid heating on temperature profiles at each layer. We consider an operating
            restriction where the system must be kept between 370-410°C.</p>


        <!-- Resultado y discusion -->

        <p class="titulo">Results and Discussion</p>

        </p>The original system, i.e. the three-layered sphere, did not change from its initial temperature of 25 °C,
        since no phase absorbs microwaves. By changing composition of the inner sphere, temperature rises. Figure 3a
        shows the temperature profile exclusively due to microwaves, and assuming a sphere mixed with a nano- susceptor
        (15% 𝑤/𝑤). Temperature profiles show the effect of the first two layers (s1 and s2), which exhibit low thermal
        conductivity. If we only consider microwave-based heating, it is actually impossible to reach the required
        temperature range. A similar issue occurs if we only consider the electrical resistance (Figure 3b). Here, it is
        possible to reach high temperatures (even beyond the limit of 410 °C), but only in the external layer. In both
        scenarios, thermal conduction plays a major role. However, the temperature reached throughout the system after
        processing for 200s, is not good enough.</p>

        <div class="image">

        <p>It is important to remember that the mathematical model is coupled. So, any change in a parameter (i.e.
            volumetric energy generation or thermal radiation) affect the temperature profile of the whole system. So,
            it is important to find strategies that achieve valid results that can be reproduced in real life.</p>
        <p>Figure 3c shows the results for the hybrid heating. Even so, it is practically impossible to achieve a good
            enough heating by only changing the composition of the inner sphere. Hence, we proceed to include a thin
            layer (now called s2) with another nano-susceptor. Such a layer will be placed between the two layers with
            low thermal conductivity (now called s1 and s3). The reason for this approach is that we are considering the
            case where the material of the layers cannot be modified. Since we have a new layer, the outermost shell is
            now called s4.</p>


        <p class="subtitulo">Considering only the electrical resistance:</p>
        <p>Figure 4 shows the temperature profile of the core and the four shells. Because of the high conductivity in
            the core, it does not exhibit any temperature gradient. Hence, its planar profile. A different scenario
            occurs in the surrounding layers. Here, temperature gradients are steep, especially in the first two layers
            (now called s1 and s3). This is due to their low thermal conductivities. The added thin layer (s2) is also
            present but has a low gradient. Temperature differences between 150-200 °C are present throughout the
            system.</p>

            <div class="image">
                <img src="img/V25-N3-9/img24.jpg" height="450px" width="auto">
            </div>

        <p>Figure 5 presents the temperature profiles after 5 and 200 seconds. As expected, the outermost layer (now
            called s4) reaches the highest temperature values. Moreover, and because of its relatively high thermal
            conductivity, temperature is constant throughout the thickness of this layer. The effect of the added layer
            is minimal. Even so, temperatures reached with only the electrical resistance are not high enough for the
            process (values remain between 50 and 280 °C).</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-9/img25.jpg" height="600px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>We now change factor 𝑓<sub>𝑠4</sub> striving to comply with temperature requirements. So, we increased it
            to 𝑓<sub>𝑠4</sub> =
            4.2 × 2 (Figure 6). This time it is possible to reach a temperature of 410 °C, but only in the external
            layer (the core only heats up to 120 °C). Additional simulations were performed with even higher values, but
            it was not possible to reach inner temperature values beyond 180 °C. So, exclusively heating with the
            electrical resistance is out of the question. Thus, we move on to analyze the behavior of microwaves.</p>

            <img src="img/V25-N3-9/img26.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>



        <p class="subtitulo">Considering only the magnetron:</p>

        <p>If we consider the effect of heating only with microwaves, the core and the thin layer (s2) will be the ones
            that contribute to heating. For the former, microwave absorption is temperature independent, so the
            temperature profile is planar and only changes depending on factor 𝑓1. Figure 7 shows there is a strong
            effect due to the low thermal conductivity of layers s1 and s3. Because the thin layer (s2) exists,
            temperature remains high, although not up to the point that the thermal process requires (even after 200 s).
            The other layers heat due to thermal conduction.</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-9/img27.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>


        <p>We now increase factor 𝑓1 up to 6.9 × 2 (Figure 8). The idea is to try and get closer to the required
            temperature profile. Since heating capabilities of layer s2 are temperature dependent, it will heat even
            more and following the function given in Table 1 (𝑓𝑠2). Temperature profiles are the best ones so far, but
            the outermost layer (s4) still exhibits a temperature around 250 °C, which is below the desired one (though
            constant). So, additionally heating with the electrical resistance should lead to a more planar profile
            within the required temperature range.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Considering the hybrid heating:</p>

        <p>Using both energy sources lead to a quick heating of the core and the thin layer (s2), as shown in Figure 9a.
            The reason for this are the nano-susceptors, since they strongly interact with microwaves. Similarly, the
            outermost layer (s4) heats because of the electrical resistance. Hence, the system reaches a homogeneous
            temperature via thermal conduction. Since a temperature between 370 and 410 °C is desired, the simulation
            also includes a system shutdown if a higher temperature is reached. Figure 9b shows the variation of the
            temperature profile with time and position within the four shells that now surround the core.</p>


        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-9/img30.jpg" height="300px" width="auto">

        <p>Figure 10 details temperature profiles for arbitrarily selected time values (5, 100, 150, 200 seconds). Based
            on it and on Figure 9, it can be concluded that the system reached a temperature distribution that complies
            with thermal requirements. This is relevant since this effect was achieved in spite of the serious
            limitations linked to the low thermal conductivity of layers s1 and s3. Even if there may be other solutions
            and configurations, the one presented herein is feasible as it ensures that at least one solution exists for
            this thermal problem. Temperature profiles reach the required value after almost 200 seconds of processing.

        <!-- Conclusiones -->
        <hr>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>In this work, we analyzed hybrid heating for a heterogeneous core-shell assembly. Such a heating approach is
            advantageous whenever it is necessary to treat composite materials, whose thermal and electrical properties
            vary abruptly across components. We followed a simulation-based approach since heating response to
            microwaves is quite sensitive to changes in dielectric properties. Hence, numerical modelling and
            experimentation is paramount for gathering data and analyzing the expected behavior of a system. This way, a
            designer can achieve better devices.</p>
        <p>For the particular thermal situation we considered, hybrid heating turned out to be a good approach. The
            presence of two layers (s1 and s3) with low thermal conductivity inhibit the generation of homogeneous
            temperature profiles with each heating source by themselves. The result: an irregular thermal treatment
            across the system.</p>
        <p>The proposed modifications allowed us to reach the required temperature range (i.e. 370-410 °C) over the
            whole thermal system. Such modifications included changing the material of the core to a mixture with a
            susceptor material. A thin layer was also added as an interface between the first two shells. It is
            important to highlight that the solution to this kind thermal problem requires a continuously rotating
            system, as was demonstrated.</p>

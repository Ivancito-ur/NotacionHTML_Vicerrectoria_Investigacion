                    Los estudiantes que van a culminar la educación media y se enfrentan a la selección de programas
                    académicos, usualmente usan buscadores web, información de programas y asesorías o pruebas

                    características sociodemográficas del estudiante ni su desempeño académico o no pueden guiar
                    adecuadamente a todos los estudiantes. Esta propuesta apoya la toma de decisiones de este grupo
                    poblacional con un Sistema de Recomendación que produce recomendaciones basadas en variables
                    sociodemográficas y datos académicos históricos de estudiantes de pregrado. Además, se compara el

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>


        <p>Education, as a process that seeks to direct and guide [1] children and young people, is a matter of general
            interest throughout the world, since the growth and economic development of a country are directly related
            to the fact that its inhabitants have access to education and that it is of quality [2]. From this arises
            the need for many countries, whether developed or not, to focus their efforts to reach more people at
            different levels of their educational trajectory and in accordance with international standards.</p>

        <p>In Colombia, of the nearly 504 thousand grade 11 students reported for 2013, about 174,600 entered higher
            education in the first and second semester of 2014, suggesting an immediate absorption rate or immediate
            transit to Higher Education in Colombia of 34.6% [3]. Likewise, 58% of the 2013 high school graduates who
            entered higher education in 2014 selected programs at the university level, 38% at the technological level
            and 4% at the professional technical level. In addition, analyses conducted by the Ministry of Education
            show that a significant number of our high school graduates enter higher education two, three, four and even
            five years after completing high school.</p>


        <p>In addition, different studies at the national level have shown that the dropout of higher education students
            is closely linked to the vocational and professional orientation processes [4]. At this point, it is
            important to talk about the initiative designed by the Center for Studies on Economic Development - CEDE, of
            the Universidad de los Andes and articulated by the Ministry of National Education called SPADIES (System
            for the prevention and analysis of dropout in Higher Education Institutions) [5], which monitors and tracks
            the problem of dropout in higher education, calculates the risk of dropout, supports the evaluation of
            strategies for each of the situations that influence dropout, such as the situation of the student, the
            academic program and the institution; Finally, it promotes the consultation, consolidation, interpretation
            and use of this information. Demonstrating the importance that has taken for the universities of the
            country, the identification of dropout rates in higher education [6].</p>

        <p>With this problem in mind, solutions proposed by other authors are sought to help students in the world to
            make one of their first decisions: which career or which undergraduate academic program will they study?
            Some proposals are focused on vocational orientation through psychological methods and student
            self-discovery. These have their beginnings with the creation of the first vocational and moral guidance
            program and the first centralized guidance service for all schools, in Michigan, by B. Davis, who was
            principal of Grand Rapids High School [7]. Others seek to guide decision making through the use of available
            tools. For example, in Colombia, websites such as Guía Académica [8] of the publishing house El Tiempo,
            which provides personalized, non-automatic advice and helps students to enroll in the university and program
            of their choice; or the portal of universities in Colombia [9], created to support students in the eleventh
            grade of secondary education in the country, is a container of information on universities, academic
            programs, scholarships, news of interest, vocational tests, among others. Also presenting more complete
            technological solutions, such as the portal created by the Ministry of National Education [10], which is a
            system that through online questionnaires captures the preferences of students and then displays results by
            breaking them down into knowledge cores, main topics of those cores and finally academic programs that
            contain those topics.</p>

        <p>Building systems that support users in their decision making is the main goal of Recommender Systems (RS). In
            particular, recommender systems seek to provide high quality and easily accessible recommendations for a
            large community of users [11]. Since the problem of this work is associated with student decision making, it
            is appropriate to orient the solution to this type of systems, balancing the needs and purposes of students
            with the implementation of methods, algorithms, equations and technical aspects developed to present an
            adequate solution [12].</p>

        <p>A search is made for academic research papers that support student decision making, mainly in the selection
            of subjects, programs or universities, and that focus on recommender systems, data mining or machine
            learning systems or machine learning.</p>

        </div>

        <p>In the reviewed works, the algorithmic tasks are focused on recommender system paradigms: Collaborative
            Filtering (CF) based, its main idea is to exploit information about the past behavior or opinions of an
            existing user community to predict which items the current user of the system will like or be interested in;
            to apply it it is not necessary to know about the characteristics of the items, but the ratings that users
            have made. Content-based, based on the description of an item's characteristics and a user profile that
            somehow describes the user's (past) interests in terms of the preferred item's characteristics, determines
            the items that best match the user's preferences. Knowledge-based, they operate from requirements set by the
            user or from an explicit recommendation rule base, no rating data is needed for the calculation of
            recommendations. Hybrid systems are technical approaches that combine several implementations of
            recommendation algorithms or components taking the strengths of different paradigms to overcome some of the
            shortcomings and problems they present [11].</p>

        <p>This paper seeks to show a solution that implements a three-component hybrid Recommender System (RS),
            comparing the performance of a classical Collaborative Filtering model with one based on Deep Learning for
            the selection of student demographic variables.</p>

        <p>Deep Learning offers a set of techniques and algorithms that help parameterize deep neural network
            structures, i.e., artificial neural networks with many hidden layers and parameters. One of the key ideas
            behind Deep Learning is to extract high-level features from a given data set. Therefore, it aims to overcome
            the challenge of the often tedious feature engineering task and helps to parameterize traditional neural
            networks with many layers [47]. The main advantage of neural networks is that the multi-layered architecture
            provides the ability to compute complex nonlinear functions that are not easily computable with other
            classification methods [48]. Hence, the application of these to the model proposed in this paper arises.</p>

        <p>The article continues in section 2 with the methods used in the research. Section 3 shows the results
            obtained and
            finally, Section 4 concludes this work.</p>

        <p class="titulo">Materials and methods
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Data </p>

        <p>The data sources obtained for this work are classified into 6 groups: the first is associated with the
            student and has relevant sociodemographic information obtained in the enrollment process and the Academic
            Program(s) he/she selected and in which he/she is enrolled in a Colombian University. The second one, the
            information of state tests that the student has presented as a requirement for secondary education degree,
            this data set has information of 3 types of exams due to the changes made by the ICFES (Colombian Institute
            for the Promotion of Higher Education) over the years; for this reason, a standardization is made to define
            within the same valuation scale the scores obtained by the students in these tests, and thus minimize the
            inconsistencies and errors that could be presented by this at the time of generating the recommendation
            models. In addition, the ICFES defines that the comparability of the students' results with the scale used
            in the second semester of 2014, the moment from which the current test scoring methodology began to be
            applied and for which the average global score of the students evaluated in each of the five tests is 50
            points with a standard deviation of 10 points [49], must be ensured. The third contains information on the
            student's academic history within the academic program(s). The fourth is the detail of the characteristics
            of each school where the students studied their high school education, obtained through the Unique Directory
            of Establishments (DUE) that has the characterization of the country's educational institutions. The fifth
            corresponds to the information on the academic programs that contains a descriptive text of each one,
            obtained from various public sources, including the description of the program, the field of action, other
            names by which it is known, among others. The sixth refers to an open text to be written by the student
            about his or her interests and tastes, which will be analyzed to refine the results.</p>


        <p class="subtitulo">Recommendation System</p>

        <p>RSs are information filtering systems that actively collect various types of data to elaborate their
            recommendations [50]. Recommender systems have their roots in various research areas, such as information
            retrieval, information filtering, and text classification, and apply methods from different fields, such as
            machine learning, data mining, and knowledge-based systems [11].</p>

        <p>There are two types of information used by RSs to predict the relevance of an item to a user: explicit
            feedback consisting of direct user feedback on an item. Ratings are a common representation of the user's
            opinion of an item, e.g., a numerical rating (1 to 5), a rating on a likert scale (Strongly Disagree,
            Disagree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree) or Binary ratings (Like, Dislike). Implicit
            feedback, on the other hand, is the collection of actions that users exert on items, these actions
            indirectly reflect the user's opinion about the item, e.g., a user may view, click, or purchase an item
            [51].</p>

        <p>The input data are obtained through a web page, in which the user enters his/her sociodemographic and state
            test information, from it the models included in the RS are run to obtain recommendations for undergraduate
            academic programs.</p>



        <p class="subtitulo">Collaborative Filtering</p>

        <p>Collaborative Filtering is considered the most popular and highly implemented technique [50]. In this work,
            its objective is to generate recommendations from information obtained from undergraduate students who have
            performed well in the academic programs in which they are enrolled. Variables such as personal,
            socioeconomic and family data, schooling, state exams, academic history and information on the schools or
            educational institutions where the students included studied high school, classification (between A and D),
            sector (official or unofficial), area (rural, rural-urban, urban, urban-rural), gender (female, male,
            mixed), character (academic, technical, technical- academic) and calendar (A or B) are analyzed.</p>

        <p>The students are in the set U that contains the information of the system users, and is represented by a
            vector of C positions thus: X<sub>u</sub> ϵ ℝ<sup>C</sup> where C corresponds to the number of
            characteristics or independent
            variables of each user; after applying normalization techniques to the data C=70.</p>

        <p>Then, the probability that user u has an associated item or class (cat) is calculated [52]:</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-14/img2.jpg" height="100px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>where N(u) is the neighborhood of the active user u, k is an element within this neighborhood, d(k,u) is the
            distance in space between the neighborhood element and the active user. The total weight is calculated as
            follows:</p>


        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-14/img3.jpg" height="100px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>To determine the neighborhood of a user, the Manhattan distance between points is measured. The Manhattan
            distance, rectilinear distance or L1 distance says that the distance between two points is the sum of the
            (absolute) differences of their coordinates. That is, the distance d, between two vectors u and v, in an
            n-dimensional real vector space with a fixed Cartesian coordinate system, is the sum of the lengths of the
            projections of the line segment projections between the points on the coordinate axis system:</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-14/img4.jpg" height="80px" width="auto">
        </div>


        <p>Where u = (u1, u2, ..., un) y v = (v1, v2, ..., vn) are vectors.</p>


        <p class="subtitulo">Deep Learning</p>

        <p>An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a network inspired by biological neural networks that are used to
            estimate or approximate features that may depend on a large number of inputs that are generally unknown. An
            ANN is constructed from nodes (neurons) stacked in layers between the feature vector and the target vector.
            A node in a neural network is constructed from the function Weights and activation. An early version of ANN
            built from a node was called Perceptron. Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary
            classifiers, functions that can decide whether an input (represented by a vector of numbers) belongs to one
            class or another. A perceptron network can be designed to have multiple layers, if it has more than one
            hidden layer it is called (<i>deep artificial neural network</i>). [47].</p>

            <img src="img/V25-N3-14/img5.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>The stochastic gradient is used as a method for weight optimization. The activation function chosen for the
            hidden layers is the sigmoid, which allows capturing small changes in the weights w and the bias b The
            sigmoid function σ(Z) obtains a probability estimate thus:</p>

        <p class="titulo">Results and Discussion</p>

        <p>The problem of predicting the student's career is posed as a multiclass classification model, where the
            objective
            variable is the program in which the student will perform well.</p>

        <p>The sociodemographic characteristics of the students are in different domains, that is, we have 24
            categorical and 8 numerical variables. Therefore, before running the models, some strategies are applied to
            standardize numerical variables by eliminating the mean and scaling to units, as well as coding categorical
            variables so that they can be used by the algorithms and generate better predictions.</p>

        <p>Standardization of a data set is a common requirement for many machine learning estimators: they can
            misbehave if individual features do not more or less resemble the normally distributed standard data. The
            standard score of a sample x is calculated as: z =((x – u))/s where u is the mean of the training samples or
            zero if with_mean = False, and s is the standard deviation of the training samples or one if with_std =
            False.</p>

        <p>In addition, the historical dataset was divided into 3 subsets, one for training which contains known
            results, the model learns on this data to then predict on the other subsets, it represents 56% of the total
            data; the second, is the testing to test the prediction of our model and that in this project corresponds to
            25% of the data; and finally the validation, which has 19% of the data that the model has not known and on
            which all the validations of the metrics are made.</p>

        <p>The distribution of the data sets for training, testing and validation was as follows:</p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-14/img7.jpg" height="300px" width="auto">
        </div>

        p>The metric chosen for model optimization is the Accuracy or prediction accuracy of the given labels and test
        data. In multiclass classification, it returns the accuracy of the subset. If the entire set of labels predicted
        for a sample strictly matches the actual set of labels, then the subset accuracy is 1.0; otherwise, it is 0.0.
        </p>

        <p>If y ̂i is the predicted value of the i-th sample and yi is the corresponding true value, then the fraction
            of correct predictions over nsamples is defined as</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-14/img8.jpg" height="100px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p class="subtitulo">Modelo KNN</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-14/img9.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Initially a run was made to determine the number of significant neighbors for the data. With this n_neighbors
            = 180 the iterations of parameter variation were executed, however, once the best parameters were defined,
            the model was varied over all possible n_neighbors to improve the accuracy of the model. The accuracy
            obtained with this model is 13%.</p>

        <p>Parameters such as the distance metric were varied between Euclidean, Manhattan and Minkowski, which are
            those that determine the distance between the points of an active user against the records that are part of
            the training; the weight is varied between uniform or distance values, where uniform indicates that all the
            points of the neighborhood have equal weights and distance indicates that a greater weight is given to those
            points that have less distance to the active user, i.e., that contribute more to the adjustment. (See Table
            3).</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-14/img10.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>In this case the best parameters are algorithm = Auto, metric = Mahattan, n_neighbors = 180 and weights =
            Distance.</p>


        <p class="subtitulo">Neural network model</p>

        <p>Parameter exploration is performed for the implemented MLPClassifier model in order to obtain the best ones
            for the final execution of the neural network. Parameters such as the number of hidden layers and neurons,
            the activation function for each hidden layer between Relu and Sigmoid (for the implementation called
            Logistic) were varied; the weight is not varied and is maintained with the stochastic gradient optimizer
            (adam) and the learning rate is also kept constant (adaptive). (See Table 4).</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-14/img11.jpg" height="800px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>The best results are obtained with the sigmoid activation function and an accuracy of 56%.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Discussion and binary classification model</p>

        <p>By applying the multilayer neural network to the data, an accuracy of 56% is obtained, which significantly
            improves the results obtained in the CF with an accuracy of 13% for 180 nearest neighbors surpassing the
            baseline of the classical CF model.</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-14/img12.jpg" height="700px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Likewise, a simple neural network is executed independently for each of the programs found in the output set
            (see Figure 4). Although this alternative is a little far from the research question, because it analyzes
            independently each of the outputs, suggesting the user to study or not each program independently, it is
            important to see the performance obtained.</p>

        <p>The accuracy improves significantly if analyzed from this perspective. The program that generates a lower
            performance is the one mostly represented in the data, i.e., Industrial Engineering. It is important to see
            this proposal with the data balanced, so that we can analyze how it impacts the results.</p>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>Academic recommender systems are a tool for students to make better decisions and set them on the path to a
            successful professional life. This work results in the feasibility of using data that institutions of higher
            education have to improve their counseling processes and decrease the burden on advisors. One of the main
            limitations of this work is that the data set used corresponds to student data from only one private
            university in the country. This causes the system to have a sampling bias that impacts the results obtained
            against the general objective.</p>

        <p>The Deep Learning approach improves the recommendations generated in the first component due to the
            optimization process of the error metric and the complexity of the neural network. However, extra work is
            required to adapt explanation mechanisms for this type of models, since in this context it is important to
            explain the results of the models to the student.</p>

        <p>There are still pending issues associated with having a larger data set of students, including information
            from students from other regions of the country to eliminate bias in the data. In addition, broadening the
            profile of academic programs through semantic enrichment systems.</p>
        <p>Further work should be done on neural network and Deep Learning strategies, as they are shown to
            significantly
            improve the performance of feature-based models.</p>

        <p>It is important to include a validation method that allows obtaining feedback from real users of the system,
            in order to analyze their level of satisfaction with the recommendations generated. Since a recommender
            system is only as good as its users think it is [24].</p>

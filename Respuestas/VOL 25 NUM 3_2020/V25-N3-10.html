                    At present, there are a large number of quality improvement techniques, making it difficult for companies to
            decide which to apply. In this research, the paste preparation area of a ceramic tile manufacturing company
            was studied, and the result of this stage is directly reflected in the quality of the final product. The
            general objective was to apply the Six Sigma methodology in the paste preparation process of a ceramic
            company; likewise, to evaluate the measurements of the variables that intervene in the paste preparation
            area of the productive process of a ceramic company and the causes that affect the quality. The application
            of the six sigma methodology requires the application of statistical tools because the term sigma represents
            the standard deviation of a distribution and is key to know its variability [1]. The implemented methodology
            is the one proposed in the DMAMC cycle: Design, Measurement, Analysis, Improvement, and Control or DMAIC
            (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control). The critical quality variables were established for each
            of the three stages of the pasta preparation area: raw materials, grinding, and atomization. The data
            obtained in the technological tests were organized in tables and graphs, to analyze the results
            qualitatively and quantitatively, using Minitab and SPSS. As a result, the evaluation of the paste
            preparation area is obtained, as well as the processing capacity of the different variables of the raw
            material stage, which exceeds 95%, except for the variables of loss by fire and viscosity. As for the
            grinding stage, the variable viscosity (Z = 1.45), with a processing capacity equivalent to approximately
            85%. There are statistically significant differences. Finally, the variables of the atomization stage have a
            higher process capacity, 98%.

                <p>
                    En la actualidad, existen un gran número de técnicas de mejora de la calidad, por lo que resulta difícil
            para las empresas decidir cuál aplicar, en esta investigación se estudió el área de preparación pasta de una
            empresa fabricante de baldosas cerámicas, el resultado de esta etapa se ve reflejado directamente en la
            calidad del producto final. Se planteó como objetivo general, aplicar la metodología Seis Sigma en el
            proceso de preparación de pasta de una empresa cerámica; asimismo, evaluar las mediciones de las variables
            que intervienen en el área de preparación pasta del proceso productivo de una empresa cerámica y las causas
            que afectan la calidad. La aplicación de la metodología seis sigma requiere de la aplicación de herramientas
            estadísticas, esto debido a que el término sigma, representa la desviación típica de una distribución y es
            clave para conocer su variabilidad (Sharma, Bhardwaj, & Kumar, 2013). La metodología implementada, es la
            propuesta en el ciclo DMAMC: Diseño, Medición, Análisis, Mejoramiento y Control o DMAIC (por sus siglas en
            ingles Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control). Se establecieron las variables críticas de calidad de
            cada una de las tres etapas del área de preparación pasta: materias primas, molienda y atomización. Los
            datos obtenidos en los ensayos tecnológicos fueron organizados en tablas, se empleó Minitab y SPSS y
            analizaron los resultados de forma cualitativa y cuantitativa. Se obtiene como resultado la evaluación del
            área de preparación pasta, así como la capacidad del proceso de las diferentes variables de la etapa de
            materias primas, las cuales superan el 95%, excepto para las variables de pérdida por fuego y viscosidad, se
            evidencian diferencias estadísticamente significativas. En cuanto a la etapa de molienda, la variable
            viscosidad (Z=1,45), con una capacidad del proceso equivalente aproximadamente al 85% y finalmente, las
            variables de la etapa de atomización cuentan con una capacidad del proceso superior, del 98%.

        <!--Introducción-->
        <p class="titulo"> Introduction
        <p>
        <p>In recent years, companies and organizations around the world are showing great interest in quality. This is
            why the six sigma methodology has been adopted in various organizations to improve their performance through
            the use of statistical analysis techniques [1]. These statistical methods have a fundamentally important
            role to play in this process: sigma process measurements, quality-critical metrics, defect measurements, and
            process capability [2]. The difference between other improvement methodologies and Six Sigma lies in the
            reduction of variation [3].</p>

        <p>However, apart from using statistical methods, the six sigma methodology expands its definition to three
            levels: Metric (Amount of deviation that exists in a data set: normal standard distribution); Methodology
            (Management of customer requirements, alignment of processes to achieve requirements and data analysis to
            minimize variations in these processes) [4]; and Management System (Apply it as a management system for the
            execution of the business strategy) [5].</p>

        <p>Companies have been forced to adapt to new challenges from customers, who are becoming more and more
            demanding, which implies increasingly efficient products and services [6]. Which has led to the study and
            application of the six sigma methodology as a systematic and structured strategy, which according to [7],
            after two decades of successful application in the manufacturing industry, it is approved as an effective
            methodology for quality improvement and a long-term commitment.</p>

        <p>A "high" sigma quality level means that defects are less likely to occur, while a "low" sigma level is more
            likely to occur. The Six Sigma level means that only 3.4 defects will be found for every million units
            produced considering the long-term capacity of the processes. [8]. That is, the area that lies within the
            limits between +3σ and -3σ would be 99,9997% [9].</p>

        <p>The Six Sigma methodology leads to the continuous improvement of processes by reducing the probability of
            defects, errors, or failures in the manufacturing or service processes, depending on where it is applied,
            the tendency is to have a controlled process with a standard deviation of six sigma. The application of this
            technique in all the functions of the company leads to a high level of quality at low costs and with a
            reduction in the cycle times of the operations, which add value; achieving high profitability and
            competitive advantage of the business [10]. The main characteristics of the six sigma methodology are:
            Achieve quality products and / or services, the client is established as a priority, takes into account
            data: which is collected and analyzed, and the participation and commitment of the personnel involved [11].
        </p>

        <p>In Colombia, the ceramic and clay industry represents one of the links in the construction and decoration
            sector where approximately 6,085 direct jobs are generated [12]. In this sense, the National Association of
            Entrepreneurs of Colombia (ANDI) states that in the ceramic sector there are immediate needs to improve this
            important engine of the national economy such as environmental performance, productive chain, logistics, and
            transportation of the finished product, as well as the industry performance.</p>

        <p>After studying the improvement methodologies through literature reviews in specialized databases, it was
            identified that most of the reported cases use statistical data to describe and even analyze the quality
            characteristics of the finished product. Consequently, six sigma was used as a pilot test of its
            implementation in the area of preparation of ceramic company paste where aspects for improvement were
            identified.</p>

        <!-- Metodología y materiales -->
        <hr>

        <p class="titulo">Materials and methods
        </p>

        <p>The methodology was implemented through the DMAIC cycle, which provides an adequate framework to guide the
            improvement process in five stages [13], where each of these has activities and tools for its execution, in
            order to identify the process, evaluate the stability, capacity and measurement systems, identify real
            causes that affect the
            process and identify and select solutions in a stage of the ceramic process.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Stage I: Define Opportunities </p>

        <p class="subtitulo-segundo">Step 1. Process description</p>

        <p>For this research, the production process of the pasta preparation area starts from the storage of raw
            materials in the company's yard (organized into 4 yards for clay material, 2 boxes for feldspar, 1 box for
            limestone, 2 boxes for cooked breaking, and 1 box for raw breaking), followed by dosing and weighing of raw
            materials in the tilting hopper according to the formulation of the paste, then the grinding stage (where it
            is homogenized and the size of the particle and formula compensation is carried out, which is carried out in
            drum or batch mills) and ends with atomization (drying process where the slip: liquid mixture of clayey and
            non-clayey materials, it is pulverized into fine droplets, it comes into contact with the hot air from the
            generator to obtain a product of constant humidity, granular, formed by small hollow spheres).</p>




        <p class="subtitulo-segundo">Step 2. Problem overview</p>

        <p>The company had ceramic defects (mismatches, gauges, deformations, black heart) influenced by alterations in
            the variables of the previous stages of the tile shaping process. When analyzing the first stage: Raw
            materials, it was evidenced poor handling of raw materials causing waste per load (pollution). Likewise,
            there is a lack of control in the exploitation and homogenization of clays in the mines, which causes
            variation in the physical-ceramic conditions of contraction, water absorption, losses due to fire, and
            dimensional instability, which is directly related to rheological behavior of the slip.</p>

        <p>Continuing with the milling stage, high consumption of electrical energy was found, which represents
            approximately 10% that the plant consumes. Finally, in the atomization stage, there is variation in the
            granulometry of the atomized powder and the percentage of humidity, these quality problems are reflected in
            the finished product.</p>

        <p>The identifiable variables in each area of this stage are different and their relationship to each other can
            only be estimated from the information obtained in the process; Due to the above, the use of statistical
            tools (regression models, control charts, and ANOVA) is proposed to estimate the relationship models and the
            variability results from the process data, ensuring that the data come from stable situations and are
            statistically significant.</p>


        <p class="subtitulo-segundo">Step 2. SIPOC. Process map</p>

        <p>The SIPOC diagram "Suppliers, Supplies, Processes, Products, and Customers", describes the main tasks and
            activities of the process [14]. The SIPOC fulfills the function of providing a broad idea of the process, it
            should be clarified that for this project it has been developed to plan the pasta preparation area and
            delineate its context [15].</p>

        <p class="subtitulo-segundo">This tool defines:</p>

        <li> (Suppliers): Provider or providers that provide the physical or information inputs necessary for the
            process
            to
            begin.</li>
        <br>
        <li>I (Input): The raw materials and / or information that trigger the process.</li>
        <br>
        <li>P (Process): Set of tasks that are carried out to carry out the entire process studied.</li>
        <br>
        <li>O (Output): What results from the process and which is finally delivered to costumer.</li>
        <br>
        <li>C (Costumer): It is defined as to whom the final product is directed.</li>
        <br>

        <p>In this particular case, the raw material suppliers were external and due to the confidentiality, that they
            handled with these inputs, some kind of approach could not be established; and internal customers, which are
            a part of the same production system. This tool makes it possible to highlight information that is relevant
            to the project, thus focusing on critical activities in the process.</p>


        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-10/img1.jpg" height="450px" width="auto">
        </div>


        <p class="subtitulo-segundo">Step 3. Select Critical Quality Variables</p>


        <p>To determine the problems associated with the process, the tool is known as Value Stream Mapping (VSM) or
            mapping of the value chain that is used to collect and process data will be used, because this technique
            allows the stakeholders of an organization, visualize and understand the process, it also allows to
            recognize the value, differentiates it from waste and creates an action plan to eliminate it within the
            process [16].</p>

        <li>Raw materials: Percentage of Moisture, Shrinkage in cooking, Water absorption, Loss by fire, Percentage of
            Sands.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Grinding: Density, Viscosity, and Residue.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Atomization: Pumping pressure of the slip, Flow rate and temperature of the drying air, Granulometry of the
            atomized powder, Density of the atomized powder, the humidity of the atomized powder.</li>

        <br>


        <p class="subtitulo-segundo">Step 4. Voice of the Customer</p>

        <p>Internal customers include employees in the pasta preparation area. Various ways were used to capture the
            voice of the internal customer (obtain the needs established or not by the customer) through surveys and
            direct observations. Then the identification and prioritization of the requirements obtained is carried out.
        </p>

        <p>A survey was designed, from the following question: What do the people who are in the processes say? Which
            was directed to the personnel of the pasta preparation area. An introduction to the subject was made to 6
            operators who gave their opinions on the various factors that could affect each section of the pasta
            preparation area. All this to
            propose a work strategy that would allow achieving the project objectives.</p>


        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-10/img2.jpg" height="300px" width="auto">
        </div>


        <p class="subtitulo">Stage II: Measure the system</p>


        <p>This phase seeks to acquire data to validate and quantify the problem / opportunity, as well as to identify
            the cause of the problem, as well as to calculate the initial sigma measurement of the process [17]. It is
            the key transition phase, as it serves to validate the problem and begin the search for causes [14].</p>

        <p>The key concepts in this phase are: Measurement (apply the metrics and determine the performance of the
            process), Variation (present in any process), Information (collection of measurements over time), and Data
            collection plan (method to obtain the data) [18].</p>



        <p class="subtitulo-segundo">Step 1. Data collection plan</p>

        <p>The data collection plan shows the information related to the process, its objective is to collect all the
            data that can help determine the variables that affect the process of the pasta preparation area.</p>

        <p>Raw Materials: Physico-ceramic analyzes are carried out on the raw materials for consumption and the
            formulation of the paste once a day. Parameters: Laboratory 3.90-4.0 (%), Production (3.70-3.75). Variations
            ˂ 1%</p>

        <p>Grinding: A sample was taken per mill, generally, 5 mills operate and two mills are carried out per shift,
            for a total of 10 mills. This depends on the operating condition of the mill. Parameters: Density: 169.0 to
            169.5 (1), 168.0 to 168.5 (2), Viscosity: 18-20 (performed with Ford Cup) and Residue: 10-10.5 (1) / 10-10.2
            (Mesh sieve 230) (2).</p>


        <p>Atomization: In the atomizers every 30 minutes and in the storage silos every shift. </p>

        <li type="circle">Quantification of Zscore and DPMO (Baseline measurement)</li>

        <p>The dependent variables to be measured in each of the stages of raw materials, grinding and atomization of
            the pasta preparation area, are quantitative variables expressed in the respective unit of measurement, for
            which a descriptive analysis was performed on each one, the control charts and estimation of the sigma
            level.</p>

        <p>Analysis of Variables Associated with the Raw Materials Stage</p>

        <li>Random sample</li>

        <p>Given that the two-month data were available, the total number of records collected was fifty-one (51), this
            is significantly lower compared to the data obtained in the grinding and atomization stages, the above
            because The company provided the data for the formulations and not for each of the raw materials that
            comprise it, as it is considered confidential, which is why there are 25 records for August and 26 for
            September. For the analysis, each of the levels of the factors or dependent variables of this process have
            been considered. Factors: Formula, Water absorption (Aa), Flexural Strength (RF). Dependent variables:
            Losses due to fire (PPF) and Percentage of shrinkage in cooking (% CC). Taking into account the above, for
            this process, simple random sampling is not used and the 51 records observed are considered.</p>

        <li type="circle"> Control charts</li>

        <p>Considering the different levels of the categorical independent variables (Factors), 4 measurements were
            taken by groups of three (3) or four (4) days, approximately one (1) daily measurement. In this sense, four
            (4) are taken as the size of the subgroup to make the control charts, the XBar-R charts are made. The
            results of the variable losses due to fire are shown in Graph 1 and the results of the variable percentage
            of shrinkage in firing are shown in Graph 2.</p>

        <p>Graph 1 shows the mean of the process for the PPF variable, which may not be stable. 1 subgroup (7.7%) is out
            of control on the Xbar chart. There is the possibility of seeing 0.7% of subgroups out of control, although
            the process is stable, specifically Subgroup 13 represented by a mean of 5.25. The overall behavior can be
            classified as cyclical. In reference to Graph 2 (% CC), the mean and the variation of the process could not
            be stable. A subgroup (7.7%) is out of control on the Xbar chart. A subgroup (7.7%) is out of control on the

        <p>There is a possibility that 0.7% of subgroups are out of control on the Xbar chart and 0.5% of subgroups are
            out of control on the R chart, even though the process is stable. It was decided to investigate subgroups
            out of control and omit those with special causes from the calculations. This situation allowed us to review
            the outliers in subgroup 5
            (Range 0.4) and 6. (Mean 4, 13).</p>

        <p>Losses due to fire in the process show an average of 5.64% with a 95% confidence interval that ranges between
            5.58 and 5.68. The variability of the set is low and reaches 0.19%. 50% of the mediations reached values
            above 5.65%, while the central 50% reached values between 5.48 and 5.80%. Regarding % CC, the mean is 4.02%

            between 3.96 and 4.08. The range of the data for% CC reached 0.4 units, pointing to a maximum of 4.25 and a
            minimum value of 3.85%.</p>

        <p>When analyzing the dispersion of the data that are out of control, these results can be attributed to
            atypical movements (special causes of variation), however, when analyzing their variability concerning the
            variation coefficients, variability values of 3.36 are found%, 1.99%, and 2.90% respectively, indicating
            that once the cases out of control have been eliminated, the general set of data is quite homogeneous.</p>


        <li type="circle">Sigma Level of the Variables: PPF and% CC</li>

        <p>Given that the data were available for the periods of August and September, the total number of records
            collected was 700, each of the levels of the factors or dependent variables are taken into account, see
            Table 1. In this way considering a 95% confidence interval and a maximum error of 5.5 points, a work sample
            of size 100 was obtained by simple random sampling. From this data set, the control graphs, descriptive
            analysis and the estimation of the sigma level were carried out.</p>

        <li type="circle">Control Graphs</li>

        <p>After considering the different levels of the categorical independent variables (factors), 10 measurements
            were taken per shift, approximately 20 daily measurements when working two shifts or 30 observations for
            days with 3 shifts. In this sense, ten (10) are taken as the size of the subgroup to make the control
            charts, consequently, the XBar-S Graphs are made. The results are shown in Graphs 5 and 6.</p>

        <p>Graph 5 shows that the process mean for the Density variable is stable, this because no group is out of

            subgroup (10.0%) that is out of control in Graph Xbar-S, this situation indicates that they review the
            outliers in subgroup 3.</p>

        <p>Graph 7 shows the control charts of the evaluated sample for the Residual variable, in the figure it can be

        <p>The density of the process presents an average of 169, 28 g/cm3 with a 95% confidence interval ranging from
            169,2 g/cm3 and 169,36 g/cm3. The variability of the set for density is low and reaches 0.4g/cm3. 50% of the

            value of 167 g/cm3.</p>

        <p>When analyzing the dispersion of the data that are out of control, these results can be attributed to
            atypical movements (special causes of variation), however, when analyzing their variability concerning the

        <li type="circle">Sigma Level of the Variables: Density, Viscosity, and Residues</li>


        <p>To estimate the sigma level of each of the dependent variables: Density, Viscosity, and Residues, a

        <p>When analyzing the sigma levels, it is found that the Density variable reaches a level Z = 2.00, a value that
            indicates that the processing capacity exceeds 96%, while for the Viscosity variable this capacity is
            decreased (Z = 1, 45) with a processing capacity equivalent to approximately 85%. Concerning the dependent
            variable Waste, the value of Z equals 2.39, which represents a high capacity of the process above 98%.

        <p>The Cp index is designed to measure the degree of global variation of the process (does not depend on the

        <p>In this way, considering a confidence interval of 95% and a maximum error of 5.5 points, a working sample of

            1 subgroup (7.7%) that is out of control in Graph Xbar-S, this situation indicates that the outliers should

        <p>One (1) subgroup (7.7%) is out of control on the Graph Xbar. 1 subgroup (7.7%) is out of control on Graph S,

        <p>The result of the preliminary analysis was carried out using statistical control letters, from which it is
            observed that the process presents cyclical behavior and that some points are above the limits, which at any
            time can get out of control.</p>

        <p>In turn, the capacity of the process was calculated where it shows that in the different variables studied in
            the pasta preparation area it exceeds 95%, except for the variables of losses due to fire (PPF) with 90% and
            the variable viscosity (V) with the 85%.</p>

        <p>It was found in the normality test carried out (the p-value is 0.04 &lt;0.05) that indicates that the
            viscosity in the grinding stage varies in each of the mills, that mill 5 produces a higher average viscosity
            compared to other mills. This shows that the averages of the water levels are not significantly different in
            the variables considered.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, in the atomization stage, the percentage of granulometry concerning the 60 mesh must be
            checked
            with special care. Likewise, the temperature levels between 91 and 96 degrees, the present average

        <p>The integration of statistics to the pasta preparation area, through stability and capacity studies, allowed
            to have stricter quality control. Communication within the company is essential for the application of the
            Six Sigma methodology, to ensure the success of its implementation it is necessary to involve all staff.</p>

        <p>Through the DMAIC method, a clearer definition of the company can be obtained, since a broad analysis of the
            different stages of a process is carried out. The methodology may be applied in other parts of the process
            such as pressing, enameling, firing, and storage and even in other companies in the ceramic sector.</p>

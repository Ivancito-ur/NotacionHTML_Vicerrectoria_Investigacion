                <p>
                    Hip dysplasia is a disease that affects medium and large dogs. It is produced by different causes
                    such as genetics, weight and care of the pet. Currently, in Colombia there are not specialized
                    mechanisms that provide comfort to their lives. Therefore, in the present study, a versatile and
                    standard device was designed to help improve the quality of life of these animals, taking as a
                    reference the breed "German Shepherd". The average weight of the previous one is 28 kilograms and of
                    medium-large size between 45 and 70 centimeters. The device was made considering the health and
                    welfare of the animals considering the mobility and safety of their limbs. Likewise, this mechanism
                    adapts to the canine condition, promoting the use and mobility of its hind legs until mobility is
                    completely lost. Its design and manufacturing cost was 100 USD.

                    La displasia de cadera es una enfermedad que afecta a los perros medianos y grandes. Se produce por
                    diferentes causas como la genética, el peso y el cuidado de la mascota. Actualmente, en Colombia no
                    existen mecanismos especializados que brinden comodidad a su vida. Por ello, en el presente estudio
                    se diseñó un dispositivo versátil y estándar que ayude a mejorar la calidad de vida de estos
                    animales, tomando como referencia la raza "Pastor Alemán". El peso medio del anterior es de 28
                    kilogramos y de tamaño medio-grande entre 45 y 70 centímetros. El dispositivo fue realizado teniendo
                    en cuenta la salud y el bienestar de los animales considerando la movilidad y seguridad de sus
                    extremidades. Asimismo, este mecanismo se adapta a la condición del canino, promoviendo el uso y la
                    movilidad de sus patas traseras hasta la pérdida total de la movilidad. Su diseño y coste de
                    fabricación fue de 100 USD.

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>

        <p>Degenerative genetic diseases are a common denominator in dog breeds, among the most prominent we can speak
            of hip dysplasia. This is a disease that affects the mobility of the animal by causing a separation of the
            head of the femur with the concavity of the hip (Figure 1). Among the most affected dog breeds according to
            the British Veterinary Association are the German Shepherd and the Golden Retriever <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
            However, the number
            of animals affected in Colombia is an unknown quantity, since not all animals receive the care, monitoring
            and registration by a veterinarian. One of the entities that has performed the due registration of some
            animals has been the Association Colombian Canine Club that registered an affectation of this disease
            greater than 10% <a href="#r2">[2]</a>. This is a considerably high number considering that in Colombia
            there are no adequate
            treatments that help reduce its progress, so in most cases the canine completely loses the mobility of its
            hind limbs and requires a hip replacement to be able to recover. To avoid pain and help improve the quality
            of life of their pets, the owners use supportive orthotics which are not manufactured in the country, so
            they are imported with high acquisition costs, compared to this problem the closest solution is an artisanal
            production that helps to support the weight of the animal, these are made without a proper design process,
            so they do not ensure the safety of the dog.</p>

        <p>The study of the different correctors of hip dysplasia in the market allowed us to know what was offered by
            the companies <a href="#r3">[3]</a>, which works as a starting point for the creation of a useful mechanism
            that innovates and
            contributes to the reduction of pain caused by the illness. Since all the hip correctors used do not take
            into account the degree of dislocation presented by the femur, which generates changes in the dog's ability
            to support itself according to the progress of the disease. Improvement options were analyzed taking into
            account the physiognomy of animals and of a specific breed, which was the animal shepherd with an average
            weight of 32 kilograms and a height of 50 cm, the design was mainly conditioned to improve society with an
            ergonomic support, low cost and adaptable to solve the problem presented in the canine.</p>
        <p>Among the alternatives that were presented was chosen to use an open Grashof mechanism with four links
            supported by a spring, which supports the loads of the body, this system allows the animal to sit and get up
            with complete comfort, this type of system has been used in other designs and presents good results in its
            application. On the other hand, a new System is added, which will be explained in greater detail within this
            article, this consists of a system of adjustable shock absorber of the support force that the dog receives.
            This fulfills the objective of this work in the creation of an innovative design that allows to solve the
            uncontrolled progress of hip dysplasia in large breeds of dogs.</p>

        <!-- Metodología y materiales -->
        <hr>

        <p class="titulo">Materials and methods
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Detailed design </p>

        <p>From a work carried out in conjunction with the research group, the effort data will be used to carry out the
            in-depth design of the entire support, since the previous one only focused on the frame of this and left
            aside some details such as those described below.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Link Design </p>

        <p>Taking into account the forces of this mechanism, we proceed to carry out the dimensioning of the links
            through the criteria of resistance of materials, evidenced in equations 1 and 2 <a href="#r4">[4]</a>, which
            seek to relate
            normal and shear stresses with a factor of safety in such a way that a safe thickness can be obtained that
            allows to support said loads, according to the material used.</p>
        <p>The forces applied for this calculation are considered in table 1.</p>

        <div class="image">

        </div>

        <p>However, a material must be selected to perform the respective design of the mechanism, so the possibility of
            using ABS PC was evaluated, which can be a more expensive material than steel, with USD 1.1 per kilogram <a
                href="#r5">[5]</a>
            and $ 0.88 respectively <a href="#r6">[6]</a>. However, ABS is easier to manipulate in its manufacturing,
            since it can be done
            by additive manufacturing, greatly reducing production costs which will be evaluated in the design
            description.</p>
        <p>The tensile strength of ABS PC is 41 MPa <a href="#r7">[7]</a>, which is sufficient to withstand the
            resulting stresses that
            are not large enough to use another, more resistant material. On the other hand, low carbon steel with a Sy
            of 140 MPa <a href="#r8">[8]</a> is used for the pins, ensuring that there is no shear failure in any pin of
            the mechanism
            that can cause serious injury to the canine.</p>

        <p>However, the elements subjected to axial compression loads were also analyzed by buckling (equations 3 and 4
            <a href="#r9">[9]</a>), in order to obtain a thickness of piece that really ensures the stability of the
            animal, without
            presenting any possible risk to a fracture or deflection. The modulus of elasticity of ABS PC is 2.1 GPa
            <a href="#r10">[10]</a>.

        <p>According to the results obtained, the thickness that each link must have is selected to support all loads.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Design damping system</p>

        <p>From the solution obtained for Grashof, we seek to innovate and apply the results in an adjustable splint
            that allows the support force to be adjusted in the canine according to the disease progression. Therefore,
            the design of a damping system that meets the requirements set forth in section 2.1 is carried out.</p>
        <p>When wanting to have a variable force system, the most effective is the use of a spring, which graduates its
            original state according to the compression to which it is found, for this purpose it is possible to use
            different mechanisms that fulfill that purpose (Figure 5) <a href="#r11">[11]</a>. From this, the nut-screw
            mechanism was
            chosen, taking into account that the transmission of the rotation can be carried out at 90 degrees with
            respect to the drive shaft. This is due to the fact that if the rotation is carried out on the same axis of
            movement, an unstable base would have to be connected to a rotating element with a fixed one. In the same
            way, the movement of the nut would have to be carried out by means of another tool since it had no space to
            do it only with the hands, while the use of a transmission at ninety degrees allows the application of
            different accessories that avoid this situation.</p>
        <p>For this 90 degree transmission, that is, perpendicular axes, the literature recommends bevel gears because
            we do not have enough space for an endless crown transmission.</p>


        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-17/img5.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>In this way, the following elements were chosen for the damping system: spring, bevel gears, bearings,
            screw-nut, drive shaft and frame. Its operation is given thanks to a force exerted by the human that becomes
            torque and is transmitted through bevel gears that connect the axes perpendicularly, with this it is
            possible to transmit the rotation in the axis of the screw, responsible for performing a relative
            displacement with respect to the nut that compresses or releases the spring and with it the force of help to
            the canine can be adjusted.</p>
        <p>However, this configuration prevents the regression of the movement, this is a consequence of the screw nut
            arrangement, since the nut does not transmit rotational movement to the screw due to the small angle of
            transmission between these elements. The amount of torque that must be applied in order to adjust the spring
            is defined by equation 5 <a href="#r9">[9]</a>.</p>


        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-17/img6.jpg" height="80px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>𝑊ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒:</p>
        <i>𝑓 = 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ</i> <br> <br>
        <i>𝐷𝑚 = 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑤 𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟</i> <br> <br>
        <i>𝑙 = 𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑤 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ</i> <br> <br>
        <p>When applying the rotation by hand, some gears are moved and they drive a screw that compresses or
            decompresses a spring, changing the compression force that it performs on the body of the shock absorber.
            The spring is calculated according to the maximum compression value, that is, by the value thrown by the
            static on the segment D. The gear ratio was chosen according to the amount of force and speed that the user
            could apply. Its design was carried out according to the load it had to bear.</p>



        <p class="subtitulo">Structural analysis using FEA</p>
        <p>Once the defined model with the real values was obtained, a test was performed with the results obtained in a
            structural analysis (finite elements) in SolidWorks. Since, with this it is possible to verify the behavior
            of the link in front of the loads submitted and to know the concentration points of stresses where failures
            can occur, so that in the case that it does not resist making the respective change of the dimensions or the
            material.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Description of the design</p>

        <p>However, the results obtained when applying the design methodology are presented. However, the analyzes were
            carried out with the restrictions on the lengths and angles of the Grashof, as these are related to the
            forces used for the sizing of the links. Below are the necessary lengths to meet the design conditions <a
                href="#r4">[4]</a>.
        </p>


        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-17/img7.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Table 3 describes the angles that form between each of them with the idea of showing a static scheme in the
            active position of the canine.</p>


        <div class="image">

        </div>

        <p>It should be noted that the axial loads in Table 1 have a division of loads in the elements L and S, since
            they are divided by a shear force that distributes the axial loads according to the direction being
            analyzed, this is how it occurs the element L_AW consisting of the axial force in L from node A to the load
            W.</p>
        <p>Starting from the static solution of the mechanism, its movement was analyzed from its initial position to
            its final position. For which, element Q, which directs the movement due to the displacement of the dog's
            hip, moves from 65 ° to 35 °, where the mechanism is in its folded position.</p>
        <p>According to this force distribution, the force to which the spring S is subjected in the range of motion
            varies between 11,498 [N] and 16,125 [N] <a href="#r4">[4]</a>, for the active and folded position
            respectively. Therefore,
            the actuator spring is selected to support compression of this element and contribute to the return of the
            mechanism to its initial position when the dog is reinstated.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that, during this range of motion, reactions R1 and R3 from the dog's limbs bear the
            greatest load, and this occurs for very short intervals of time <a href="#r4">[4]</a>. Therefore, the
            dimensions of the
            elements are designed to withstand the loads when the dog is standing.</p>
        <p>However, all measures of link widths are chosen taking into account the buckling criteria, since this method
            is the most critical. The widths of each of the links are those referred to in table 4 with a thickness of
            10 mm for all.</p>

        </div>

        <p>This value is of the utmost importance, since buckling is one of the failures that tends to occur when having
            axial loads in the links. Note that the width values are governed by this parameter by giving much greater
            resistance failure, this is logical because the thickness measurement is small compared to the large length
            of the elements.</p>

        <p>Table 5 shows the pin diameters. Which are normalized to the measure of 3,175 [mm] equivalent to 1/8 of an
            inch and with that the safety factor that was 2 is increased according to the normalized value of the
            diameter, which is better for the quality of the mechanism, since it ensures a Less risk in its operation.
        </p>
        <p>It should be noted that, having two different materials in contact, pin and links, it is required to use
            bearings, to avoid deformation of the ABS due to the difference in hardness between them.</p>
        <p>Within the shock absorber, the screw, nut, spring and gear parameters are selected according to the torque to
            which the screw is subjected, since it is necessary that the system manages to compress the spring or
            decompress it according to the disease progression. Therefore, they were selected as found in the different
            catalogs <a href="#r12">[12]</a>, in such a way that they achieved the mentioned objective. Which is
            reflected in table 6, 7
            and 8.</p>

        <div class="image">

        <p>The bevel gear system was designed with a 1: 1 ratio to avoid increasing the size of the mechanism. The
            torque found in the screw was 116 N-mm to compress the spring by means of the vertical movement of the nut,
            described in equation 5.</p>
        <p>Having all the parts defined, a damping mechanism is obtained as illustrated in Figure 6, in which the
            operation of the bevel gears to transmit the movement to the screw axis can be appreciated.</p>

        <p>Having all the mechanism defined, the design verification is carried out by means of the FEA analysis where
            it is possible to see the behavior of the mechanism against the different efforts that occur in the element,
            so that the stresses can be located and readjusted.</p>
        <p>However, Figure 7 shows us that the values do not exceed the yield strength of the material, validating that
            the mechanism works correctly when tested in an animal.</p>

        <p>It is important to note that the buckling does not occur to a large extent because its deformation does not
            exceed 2 millimeters. Likewise, it is evident that link L is the element that suffers the most effort
            because the weight falls mainly on it. In this way it can be said that, in a real construction, the frame
            would be expected to support the different loads contemplated.</p>
        <p>Having all the variables defined and verified, these are adjusted to a support that comforts the animal
            (Figure 8).</p>

        <p>In this way, figure 9 allows the reader of this article to give an idea of how the design is implemented in a
            canine, since its construction is not contemplated within the scope of this project.</p>

        <!-- Conclusiones -->
        <hr>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>The design was made taking into account a theoretical and contextual framework in which a support was
            made
            for medium and large-sized dogs with hip dysplasia, so that more people had access to the solution to
            help
            the animal, as well as providing veterinarians with a new, more effective and economical medical
            alternative.</p>
        <p>Bringing the design to the construction and its proper use correctly will have benefits for both humans
            and
            animals, since the former can help your pet and interact with it, because it will already have a support
            for
            your hip improving your health and comfort.</p>
        <p>The alternative of using Grashof together with the damping system proves to be a viable option for the
            correction of dysplasia, which could lead to further research for its use in related diseases such as
            LTV
            (Lumbosacral Transitional Vertebrae).</p>
        <p>When manufacturing the framework by additive manufacturing, production costs are greatly reduced, so that
            the
            manufacture of the entire corrector manages to be less than $ 110, this is of vital importance, since
            the
            reduction in price with respect to commercial correctors it is 56%, (market price of 250 USD) [13]
            facilitating its acquisition.</p>
        <p>The total weight of the corrector is approximately 2 Kg, this estimated by the computer tool in which the
            CAD
            was designed, so that a design with a relatively low weight was achieved, which facilitates the setting
            and
            transport of the mechanism.</p>
        <p>It was possible to design an instrument that complied with the medical, financial and innovative
            requirements, referred to in section 2.1. Giving in response a system with the ability to adapt
            according to
            the severity of the disease and the position in which the animal is.</p>

                    In the framework of the free electron inside a semiconductor, we, numerically, analyzed the energy
                    spectrum and electronic density of a GaAs-InAs Core-Shell Nanowire with hexagonal cross-section for
                    a single electron. The effect of a magnetic field applied in the direction of growth of the
                    structure was also considered, and the corresponding Schrödinger equation for the localization
                    probability in the transverse plane of the structure, in the presence of the field, was solved using
                    the software COMSOL Multiphysics®. The results allow the identification of energy shells, each
                    composed by six levels, as a consequence of the hexagonal geometry, where six potential wells are
                    created by the abrupt change of direction in the borders of the structure. Additionally, the

        <!--Introducción-->
        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>
        <p>The growing interest in semiconductor nanowires (NWs), due to their Transport properties of optical and
            electronic excitations [1], [2], has led to diverse and increasingly specialized studies, both theoretical
            and experimental. The study of NWs allows to broaden the understanding and refine the control over their
            spectral properties, in order to achieve their practical implementation in many branches of industry, from
            food [3] and biomedicine [4] to satellite technology devices [5], among others.</p>
        <p>Since the first NW obtained in 1987 at Bell Laboratories, the interest in the morphological possibilities of
            these structures, through the use of different fabrication techniques and different materials, resulted in
            the creation, in 1997, of the first core-shell nanowires (CSNWs). A CSNW consists of a NW accompanied by
            coaxial shells, or nanotubes (NT), of different semiconductor materials. However, it was not until 2002 that
            the eagerness for the characterization of these nanostructures became evident, since the different
            configurations of CSNWs present advantages with respect to the NW without a shell; among these advantages
            are the increase in photonic absorption efficiency [6], [7], spontaneous emission [8], [9], exciton surface
            emission [10], capacitance and electrical conductivity [11], improvement in spin-orbit coupling [12], and
            decrease in other properties, such as thermal conductivity [13].</p>
        <p>The synthesis of CSNW starts with the growth of the core, i.e., a NW, usually fabricated by vapor deposition
            techniques. The NW serves as a support for the shell and its geometry depends on the constituent elements,
            e.g., fabrication of GaAs NWs results in hexagonal cross-section nanostructures, due to the crystal
            structure of GaAs. The geometry of the shell is determined by the cross-sectional shape of the NW; such a
            shell can be obtained by pyrolysis on the lateral surfaces of the NW. In particular, the growth of InAs
            shell on GaAs is a non-homogeneous process, because it starts with the formation of islands on the surface;
            however, these islands eventually widen until they merge together and form a single layer that begins to
            increase in thickness homogeneously, provided that the appropriate conditions for its optimal growth are
            established [14] - [16].</p>
        <p>In the literature review conducted, more experimental studies [7] - [10], [12], [15], [17] - [20], for both
            fabrication and characterization of CSNWs, were found than theoretical ones [21] - [28]. Among these
            studies, works on CSNWs with circular cross-section predominate [24] - [28], largely due to the difficulties
            in solving the Schrödinger equation for cross-sections that do not present circular symmetries. Among the
            theoretical works reported for the latter symmetries are the study of the behavior of a hydrogenoid donor
            under the effects of electric and magnetic fields [26] and under the effect of fields induced by high
            frequency lasers [27]. Theoretical investigations of CSNWs with non-circular cross sections include studies
            of the behavior of single and multi-electron systems with emphasis on the conductance [21], optical [2],
            electronic [22] properties and the effect of the energy gaps of the materials on the electronic probability
            density of the systems [23].</p>
        <p>It is noteworthy that CSNWs with non-circular cross section are ideal candidates for the creation of quantum
            rings (QRs) with high degree of resemblance to geometrically perfect structures, which makes them the most
            appropriate structures for the observation of quantum topological effects such as (ABO) [29].</p>
        <p>The aforementioned morphological feature is one of the reasons why CSNWs have been suggested for the
            construction of artificial molecules. Currently, arrays of coupled QDs are the most commonly used
            nanostructures to achieve artificial atom conformations; however, an artificial arrangement presenting
            molecular electronic structure can be obtained with inhomogeneous QRs, where variations in cross- sectional
            size or radius of curvature along the structure result in potential wells located in small regions [29]
            - [31]. CSNWs are ideal candidates for this type of structures due to the low diffusion of material in their
            heterojunction, since it allows obtaining configurations with high similarity to geometrical structures with
            high symmetry, as is the case of regular polygons. In particular, the synthesis of GaAs-core CSNWs is a good
            candidate for the elaboration of artificial benzene molecules due to their regular hexagon morphology [31].
        </p>
        <p>In this work we seek to contribute to the understanding of the properties of mono-electronic systems formed
            by semiconductor CSNWs, specifically those with hexagonal cross section. This contribution corresponds to
            the calculation of the energy spectrum and electron density of a conduction electron confined in a CSNW of
            hexagonal cross section with GaAs core and InAs shell under the effect of a magnetic field applied in the
            longitudinal direction of the NW, which allows the observation of (ABO), in the framework of the effective
            mass approximation.</p>
        <p class="subtitulo"> Model and Simulation Details</p>
        <p>The study of nanostructured systems by means of models with idealized (circular) symmetry allows to reach a
            certain understanding of them. However, the morphological characterization of such systems, thanks to
            instruments such as scanning electron microscopes, has revealed different geometries that diverge from the
            ideal ones [16] – [32]. The analytical solution of the equations describing systems with non-idealized
            geometries is a very difficult challenge to solve, therefore, it is important to consider alternative
            methods for the study of non-ideal geometries, such as the solution of the equations by means of the finite
            element method.</p>
        <p>From the experimental point of view, the fabrication of NWs from materials with Wurtzite and Zinc Blende
            crystal structures, typical of binary semiconductor compounds, usually results in NWs with hexagonal cross
            section when fabricated by vapor deposition techniques [16]. Given the importance of this type of
            semiconductors in NW production [9], [15], [19], in this work a CSNW with hexagonal cross section is
            studied, modeled as shown in Figure 2.</p>

        </div>

        <p>For the study of this CSNW, equation (1) was used, which corresponds to the time-independent Schrödinger
            equation, where 𝐵<sub>0</sub> is the magnitude of the magnetic field, V(𝑟⃗) is the structural confinement
            potential,
            different in each of the materials, and with the cyclotron frequency 𝜔<sub>𝑐</sub>.</p>

        <div class="image">

        </div>

        <p>Equation (2) is formulated under the effective mass approximation, the most widely used parameterization in
            semiconductor physics [33]. This approximation consists of incorporating the effect of the periodic
            potential of the crystal structure on the apparent mass of the charged particle interacting with the
            structure. The effective mass is characteristic of each material, since the potential of each crystalline
            structure is derived from its molecular composition, for the case of GaAs and InAs we have, respectively,
            values of 0.065 and 0.026 times the mass of the free electron [34].</p>

        <p>Dirichlet conditions were imposed at the outer boundary of the structure. The reference confinement potential
            is that of InAs, with respect to which that of GaAs has a value of 0.697 eV. The potential outside the
            structure was assumed to be infinite because the structure is considered to be surrounded by air. The core
            radius, taken as the distance from the center to any of its six vertices, is fixed at 50 nm, while the shell
            thickness w takes values between 1 and 15 nm.</p>
        <p>An important experimental aspect is the ratio between the length of the CSNW and the radius of its cross
            section, which is usually of the order of 1000 [8], [19], [35], so that the structural confinement in the
            longitudinal direction is not comparable with that of the cross section. The ratio of 1000 to one between
            the length of a CSNW and its radius allows to consider only the CSNW cross section as the one responsible
            for the quantum confinement, since the electron spectrum in a structure with lengths of tens or even
            hundreds of microns can be considered continuous.</p>
        <p>To solve equation (1), the two-dimensional finite element method was used, implemented with COMSOL
            multiphysics®, with triangular elements and an inhomogeneous and controlled meshing for which the sides of
            each element were in the range between 0.0131 and 4 nm, and the resolution of the narrow regions was 7
            elements.</p>
        <!-- Results and Discussion -->
        <hr>

        <p class="titulo">Results and Discussion</p>

        <p>In the following, we discuss the results of the solution of equation (1), which represents the electron
            quantum-mechanical behavior in the transverse region of the hexagonal CSNW under the effective mass
            approximation. The results include the analysis of the effects of shell thickness and of the application of
            a magnetic field in the longitudinal direction of the NW on the electronic probability density, the energy
            spectrum and the ABOs.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Effect of shell thickness</p>

        <p>The possibility of fabricating NWs surrounded by a shell, which thickness can be controlled during the growth
            process [35], [15], is one of the most interesting features of CSNWs, mainly because the thickness of the
            shell determines some of their properties, as a consequence of known quantum phenomena occurring at small
            scale. In the cross section of a CSNW the shell can be considered as a quantum ring surrounding the core. In
            this work, the shell corresponds to a hexagonal ring with uniform width w.</p>
        <p>Figure 2 shows the dependence of the CSNW ground state energy on the thickness of the shell w. It can be seen
            how, as w decreases, the ground state energy increases markedly and for a valuew = 2.4 nm it remains
            approximately constant. This behavior is due to the configuration of the structural confinement potential,
            in which the shell acts as a well which bottom is 697 meV below the ground level.</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-19/img3.jpg" height="450px" width="auto">
        </div>

        The threshold value of the shell
        <p>Figure 2 shows, that when the thickness of the shell is reduced to a value of about w = 2.4 nm the minimum
            thickness that allows, at least one localized state in the shell is reached. We have called this value the
            threshold value, because it indicates the minimum thickness that the shell can have before the electronic
            wave function overflows, from the shell to the core and is therefore related to a change from quantum ring
            to dot regime. This behavior is evidenced in Figure 3. For values of w greater than the threshold value,
            Figure 3(a), the electron is confined in the shell. For w values close to the threshold value, the electron
            presents a certain probability of being in the core, Figure 3(b), while for w values much lower than the
            threshold value, Figure 3(c), it can be seen how the electron is completely located in the core.</p>
        <p>When the electron is confined in the core (w &lt; 2.4 nm, see Figure 3(c)), the ground state energy (698 meV)
            is
            slightly higher than the confining potential in GaAs (697 meV). For the opposite case, and with a
            thickness significantly larger than the threshold thickness, it is observed that the highest electronic
            probability density is found at the six corners of the shell, Figure 3(a). The hexagonal geometry of the
            shell means that, in the straight segments that form the sides of the hexagon, the confining potential
            due to the curvature is zero, while at the vertices, which can be considered as pointy corners because
            the curvature becomes infinite, the potential takes the form of true potential wells [30]. For this
            reason, the electronic probability distribution of the ground state shows maxima at these vertices. For
            values of w close to 2.4 nm, in the so-called transition zone, tunneling is observed towards the central
            region, Figure 3(b), in addition to a change in electronic localization, which moves from the vertices
            to the straight regions between them; this change in confinement can be attributed to the repulsive
            effect of the Dirichlet conditions imposed on the boundary, which for thicker shell (w &gt;&gt; 2.4 nm) play
            a
            less noticeable role.</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-19/img4.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>The confinement at the vertices, for w = 2.4 nm, can be considered as an attractive effect of the vertices.
            The electron probability density observed when such an attractive effect is present has a regular hexagonal
            geometry similar to that observed in benzene (C6H6) [36].</p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Energy and electron density for shell greater than the threshold value.</p>

        <p>Although the limiting value of w has been taken as 2.4 nm, it is for values of w &gt;7.0 nm that the electron
            density obtained for CSNW resembles that of the benzene molecule, Figure 4(a). For w values between 2.4 and
            7.0 nm the energy level structure of CSNW, Figure 4(b), although similar to that of benzene, does not
            completely match.</p>
        <p>In Figure 4(a) a comparison can be made between the 4 lowest energy states (52.4 to 56.68 meV) and their
            probability densities obtained with those for benzene [36], since agreement is observed with the bonding and
            anti-bonding states observed in that molecule, and agreement is also found in the degeneracy of these.</p>
        <p>The four higher levels (58.72 to 72.35 meV) present the same degeneracy pattern, and increase of nodes along
            the shell, expected due to the energetic increase. Levels 4 and 5 of this graph present similarities, both
            present 3 nodal axes, and it could be thought that they should be part of a single degenerate level, however
            level 4 requires less energy, since its maxima are located at the vertices of the structure, where there are
            attractive regions produced by the change of curvature [30], while level 5 requires more energy, since its
            maxima are located in the straight regions of the shell.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Energy and electron density for shell around the threshold value</p>

        <p>Figures 4 (b) and (c) show the eight lowest energy states for a hexagonal CSNW configuration with shell
            thickness w = 2.5 and 2.45 nm. In contrast to what is observed for shells with w &gt; 7.0 nm, Figure 4(c)
            shows
            that the ground state does not exhibit vertex confinement. The first five energy levels show the same
            degeneracy as in the previous case, but at different energies. Beyond the fifth energy level, for w = 2.5 nm
            and at an energy of 699.50 meV, the degeneracy of the levels is different than for 15 nm shell.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Figure 4(c) shows, for the three lower levels, similarity with the cases for w = 15 nm and 2.5 nm, however
            the upper levels, 4 to 7, do not show agreement. At level 4, an infiltrated state is observed with a higher
            probability in the central region of the structure, and a degenerate level, 6, in a similar situation. These
            two levels, which in the case of Figure 4(b) were at levels 6 and 8 respectively, have decreased with
            decreasing shell thickness.</p>
        <p>This difference in probability and de-generations densities may be associated with boundary conditions, the
            effect of which is more noticeable with small shell thickness and is more appreciable in regions near the
            corners. The reorganization of levels presented by the system due to the thickness of the shell can be seen
            in Figure 5.</p>

        <p>Figure 5 should be analyzed in a right-left direction. On the far right are 8 levels, which are maintained
            for shell widths greater than that presented in the figure, and which can be seen in Figure 4. The lower
            three levels remain unperturbed, as can be seen in the three electron density plots in Figure 4. Each
            intersection of the graph represents a breakup of the degenerate states and reorganization of them; moving
            from the right to the left, an intersection is found between levels 7 and 8, this results in the degeneracy
            of level 8; further to the left, it is observed that the same happens with levels 6 and 7, the latter
            becoming degenerate again, and leaving level 6 non-degenerate, these two effects can be seen in Figure 4(b).
            Between 2.50 and 2.45 nm there is a crossover between levels 4, 5 and 6, the consequences of this can be
            seen in Figure 4(c), and the decrease in the energy spectrum of level 4 is observed, which is very similar
            to that which in Figure 4(b) corresponds to level 6.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Effect of the magnetic field</p>

        <p>When exposing the CSNW to an external magnetic field perpendicular to the cross section of the nanostructure,
            an interaction between the electron and this field arises. For shell thicknesses greater than the threshold
            value, upon application of the magnetic field a change in the electron probability density at the vertices
            of the hexagon was observed, Figure 6(a), suggesting that the magnetic interaction alters the confinement
            effect of the shell described in the previous section.</p>
        <p>The effect of the magnetic field can be observed as a distortion of the base state wave function, which has
            six maxima, one at each vertex for w greater than the limiting value. Unlike the six lobes observed in the
            absence of the magnetic field, Figure 3(a), when the field is present a larger number of these are observed,
            Figure 6(a). This behavior is also present for shell widths close to the threshold value, Figure 6(b). In
            Figure 6(b), the radial confinement effect imposed by the diamagnetic term in equation (1) is also observed,
            in addition to the tunneling to the central region of the structure.</p>
        <p>Figure 7 shows the energy spectrum dependence on the intensity of the applied magnetic field. In this
            spectrum one can clearly appreciate the breakup of the degenerate levels due to the interaction of the
            electron with the magnetic field, in addition to the ABOs and how these oscillations are affected by the
            geometry of the system. Unlike what is observed in a circular QR [37] in ABOs no crossover between all
            energy levels is observed, instead the grouping in subbands of six oscillating energy levels is observed;
            this grouping in six bands can be attributed to the hexagonal structure. Such ABOs present a period 𝑇 =
            𝛥𝐵 = ℎ/𝑒𝜋𝑅2, where R is the geometric mean radius of the structure, which was calculated by taking into
            account both the radius of a regular polygon and the apothem.</p>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>The electronic localization effects due to the presence of a shell in nanowires with core-shell structure in
            the presence of external fields were studied. The effects were studied in the effective mass approximation
            by means of the solution of the Schrödinger equation with the finite element method. The results obtained
            show, on the one hand, the capability of the finite element method for the solution of partial differential
            equations in complex geometries and, on the other hand, the use of such numerical solutions to study
            physical phenomena of complex nanostructures. In addition, modeling the shell as a structure with a finite
            barrier potential made it possible to demonstrate the modification suffered by the energy spectrum of the
            system due to tunneling and quantum overflow of the wave function towards the core, especially when there
            are strong magnetic confinement conditions.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that one of the most interesting results obtained in the study was the similarity of the
            electronic probability densities for shell widths greater than 7 nm with those of the benzene molecule. The
            similarities found suggest that these structures are possible candidates for building artificial molecular
            systems with great potential for future optoelectronic applications.</p>

        <p>

        <p>
            To evaluate milk production (MP), daily weight gain(DWG), calving interval (CI), and use of
            artificial insemination in the municipalities Cacota, Chitagá, Pamplona, Pamplonita, Silos, and
            Mutiscua (Norte de Santander, Colombia), a sample of farms were selected (n = 113) and a direct
            survey was applied. Two farm sizes were characterized: up to 10 animals (47.8%) and > 10 animals
            (52.2%). The farms were grouped by quartiles of altitude in meters above sea level (MASL) (Q1:
            1600-2300 (n = 27), Q2: 2300-2600 (n = 28), Q3: 2600-2800 (n = 28), Q4: 2800-3800 (n =
            30). The Normande breed predominates (38.2%), followed by Holstein (23.0%). The presence of
            Normande decreases with the decrease in altitude, being different between Q4 and Q1 (P = 0.009).
            Zebu genotypes (Gyr, Brahman) appear in Q2 and increase in Q1 (P = 0.03). The MP was 5.5 ± 0.2
            L / cow * day, with higher productions in Chitagá and Mutiscua (6.4 ± 0.6 and 6.1 ± 0.4 L / cow
            * day respectively), and lower (P = 0.005) in Pamplonita 4.4 ± 0.4 L / cow * day. The DWG was
            367 ± 17 g / day, and tended to be lower (P = 0.09) in farms up to 10 animals (336 ± 23.3 g / day,
            n = 46) compared to farms with more than 10 animals (393 ± 23.7 g / day, n = 53). Larger farms
            (> 10 animals) had a lower average of CI with 393 ± 5.5 days (n = 59), compared with farms of
            up to 10 animals (419 ± 11.4 days, n = 54; P = 0.04).For the Q1 quartile, the CI was higher (438
            days, P = 0.01) than Q4 (382 days). The use of semen from 9 breeds for artificial insemination
            was reported, 48.8% corresponded to specialized dairy breeds (Jersey 27.9%, Ayrshire 11.6%,
            and Holstein 9.3%), 30.2% European dual-purpose breeds (Normande 27.9%, Simmental 2.3%),
            and 21.0% zebu breeds or their crosses (Gyr 11.7%, Guzerá 4.7%, Girolando 2.3%, and Brahman
            2.3%). The present characterization allows diagnosing the current state of the livestock industry
            in the studied region and projecting technical improvement guidelines.

        <p>
            Para evaluar la producción de leche (PL), la ganancia diaria de peso en las crías (GDP), el
            intervalo entre partos (IEP) y el uso de la inseminación artificial en los municipios Cacota,
            Chitagá, Pamplona, Pamplonita, Silos y Mutiscua (Norte de Santander, Colombia), se seleccionó
            una muestra de granjas (n = 113) y se aplicó una encuesta directa. Se caracterizaron dos tamaños
            de explotaciones: hasta 10 animales (47,8%) y> 10 animales (52,2%). Las fincas se agruparon
            por cuartiles de altitud en metros sobre el nivel del mar (MSNM) (Q1: 1600-2300 (n = 27),
            Q2: 2300-2600 (n = 28), Q3: 2600-2800 (n = 28), Q4: 2800-3800 (n = 30). Predomina la raza
            Normando (38,2%), seguida de la holstein (23,0%). La presencia de la Normando disminuye con
            el descenso de la altitud, siendo diferente entre el Q4 y el Q1 (P = 0,009). Los genotipos cebú
            (Gyr, Brahman) aparecen en el Q2 y aumentan en el Q1 (P = 0,03). La PL fue de 5,5 ± 0,2 L /
            vaca * día, con mayores producciones en Chitagá y Mutiscua (6,4 ± 0,6 y 6,1 ± 0,4 L / vaca * día,
            respectivamente), y menor (P = 0,005) en Pamplonita 4,4 ± 0,4 L / vaca * día. La GDP fue de 367 ± 17 g/día,
            y tendió a ser menor
            (P = 0,09) en las explotaciones de hasta 10 animales (336 ± 23,3 g/día, n = 46) en comparación con las
            explotaciones de más de 10
            animales (393 ± 23,7 g/día, n = 53). Las explotaciones más grandes (> 10 animales) tuvieron una media más
            baja de IEP con 393
            ± 5,5 días (n = 59), en comparación con las explotaciones de hasta 10 animales (419 ± 11,4 días, n = 54; P =
            0,04). Para el cuartil
            Q1, el IEP fue mayor (438 días, P = 0,01) que el Q4 (382 días). Se notificó la utilización de semen de 9
            razas para la inseminación
            artificial, de las cuales el 48,8% correspondían a razas lecheras especializadas (Jersey 27,9%, Ayrshire

        <p>
            Bovine livestock in Colombia contributes 1.4% of the national gross domestic product (GDP), 21.8% of the
            agricultural
            GDP, and 48.7% of the livestock GDP, becoming the most important economic activity in the Colombian
            countryside,
            with an inventory of 24.8 million heads [1]. In Norte de Santander there are around 456,000 cattle,
            distributed in
            regions defined by the departmental government [2].
        </p>

        <p>
            The southwestern region of the Norte de Santander department (Colombia) includes the municipalities of
            Cacota,
            Chitagá, Pamplona, Pamplonita, Silos, and Mutiscua. The geography corresponds to the mountainous area of the
            eastern Andes of Colombia in an altitude range of 1600 to 4000 meters above sea level (MASL) where livestock
            activity stands out as a subsistence economic activity [2]. This region is part of a transition zone to the
            paramo
            ecosystem that is currently under government protection measures through territorial delimitation and
            control of
            economic activities that may affect the fragile paramo environment [3]. It is known that in the southwestern
            region
            about 38,600 cattle are vaccinated, however, there are currently no documented records on the livestock
            activity of
            this particular area, although it is known that there are small farms with few animals where mainly
            unspecialized
            systems predominate. subsistence. In oreder to generate a baseline of knowledge about the characteristics of
            the
            region and the farms, associated with productive variables that could be used for the development of
            livestock activity,
            this study was developed with the objective of describing the productive ( breeds, farming systems, milk,
            and meat
            production) and reproductive (calving interval, use of artificial insemination) characteristics of the
            cattle farms in the
            area, associated with geographic factors (altitude) and development (level of education).

        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Selection of farms and classification </p>

        <p>The list of existing livestock farms in the region was obtained through the Norte de Santander livestock
            committee.
            The number of farms to be surveyed was determined using the equation for determining the sample size for
            finite
            populations [4]:</p>

        <p>α = confidence level (alpha) </p>
        <p>Z = 1- α/2 </p>

        <p>
            To determine the sample size, 5% was used as a margin of error and 95% as a confidence level [4], and the
            total
            number of farms was considered as the sample universe (N), according to the classification of farm size by
            number
            of animals (1-50, 51-100, 101-500, and > 500 animals) used by the Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA)
            [5]. Using
            a random number generator (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) the farms to be visited were selected from
            the
            total list.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Design and application of the survey </p>

        <p>
            A survey addressed to livestock producers was designed including referential aspects in terms of geography
            (altitude,
            topography), farm size (bovine inventory), zootechnical characteristics (type of productive system,
            predominant
            breeds, milk production (MP), weight gain (DWG), the calving interval (CI), nutritional and sanitary
            management),
            and aspects related to the degree of social and technological development (education of the producer,
            infrastructure,
            systematization, technical-professional assistance, and use of artificial insemination). A producer was
            defined as
            the individual owning the title of property of animals registered in the foot-and-mouth disease vaccination
            records
            (RUV) run by the ICA. Contact with cattle producers was established in collaboration with entities such as
            farmers
            associations, municipal technical assistance units, and secretaries of agriculture. In case of declining to
            participate in
            the survey, the random number generator was used to select a new property until the specified number of the
            sample
            was met.
        </p>

        <p>
            The fieldwork consisted of physical mobilization to each of the coordinated farms to personally apply the
            survey
            to the producer. The visit included the georeferencing of the property (GPS status 8.0.170-PRO), the
            measurement
            of the altitude in meters above sea level (MASL), the visual verification of the type of topography, the
            established
            pastures, breeds present, animal inventory, productive system, infrastructure and equipment, and the living
            conditions
            and development of the residents on the farm. Each application of the survey instrument took between 1-2
            hours,
            depending on the understanding of the points in question and the details provided by each producer.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Analysis of the information
        </p>

        <p>
            The data obtained through the surveys were tabulated in MS-Excel (Microsoft Office 2010), the sort and
            filter tool
            was used to classify the explanatory variables altitude and farm size (number of animals). For the breed
            variable,
            a frequency histogram was made in which the percentages of breeds for each altitude group are presented. For
            the
            productive (MP, DWG) and reproductive (CI) response variables, averages and standard error (SE) were
            determined
            as a measure of dispersion. The data were grouped by altitude ranges (MASL) and by farm size (number of
            animals);
            and for the MP, DWG and CI variables, groups were compared by performing an analysis of variance using the
            GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (SAS version 9.3, Cary, NC, USA). The data on the use of the artificial
            insemination
            (AI) technique is presented as a percentage of use related to the total farms, were treated as a binary
            variable (1 = use
            of AI; 0 = No use),and analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure with the binary distribution within the model.
            The
            producers' education level was assigned the following values: (0 = primary basic education, 1 = secondary
            education,
            2 = higher education) according to the level of training reported by each of the respondents, and the
            averages of the
            municipalities were compared by analysis of variance.

        </p>

        <p>
            The southwestern area of the Norte de Santander department includes six municipalities that house a total of
            38,577
            head of cattle (8.5% of the departmental total of 455,871 cattle) distributed in 3,773 cattle farms. Table 1
            shows the
            distribution according to the size of the farms (number of animals). As the first important finding, 91.2%
            of the farms
            evaluated were located within the first size classification group established by the ICA (1-50 animals),
            while the
            remaining three groups (51-100, 101-500, and &gt; 500) comprised 8.8% of the properties. This way, in order
            to
            improve
            the precision of the analyzes, the majority group was sub-divided into ranges of 1-10 (47.8%), and 11-50
            animals per
            farm (43.4%), and the remaining groups with a number greater than 51 animals per farm were grouped (8.8%,
            Table
            1). Similar values are reported at the national level, whereby in 2016 43.6% of farms had less than 10
            animals [5]. The
            municipalities of Mutiscua (61.1%) and Chitagá (59.3%) tend (P = 0.1) to have a greater number of small
            farms (1 to
            10 animals) than the municipalities of Silos (31.3%) and Cacota (33.3%).

            of the department of Norte de
            Santander was 2575 ± 45 MASL. The averages and ranges of altitude are shown in table 1. The municipality
            with the
            lowest altitude is Pamplonita with an average of 1739 ± 29 while the municipality of Silos presents the
            highest average
            with 3090 ± 79 (P &lt; 0.0001). It is important to highlight that within each municipality there is a wide
            range of altitudes
            between farms, which led us to propose a classification by quartiles of altitude to compare groups of
            properties of
            similar altitudes located in different municipalities. The quartiles were obtained by organizing in
            descending order
            the 113 data records of altitude from the 6 municipalities to form four quartiles of approximately 28
            observations. </p>

        <p>
            The most predominant breed in the six municipalities of the southwestern region of the department of Norte
            de
            Santander is the Normande (38.2%), followed by the Holstein breed with 23.0%. Table 2 shows the
            participation
            percentages of the different breeds for each of the municipalities. There is minor participation of other
            European-type
            breeds that together reach 16.2%, emphasizing the Jersey (6.4%) and Brown Swiss (4.4%) breeds in this group.
            The
            Mixed group (14.2%) comprises animals that are the product of successive, undetermined crosses of different
            breeds,
            including European, Indicus, or Creole breeds.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, 8.3% of breed participation of the southwestern region corresponds to Zebu cattle (Brahman and Gyr)
            or
            with a greater percentage of these breed (including Girolando and Simbrah). The presence of zebu genotypes
            was
            exclusive to the municipalities of Pamplonita, Pamplona, and Cacota and absent in the three remaining
            municipalities
            (Chitagá, Silos, and Mutiscua), which is associated with the elevation ranges of the municipalities. By
            unifying
            the data of the analyzed farms and classifying them according to their altitude, it is possible to ratify
            patterns of
            influence of certain breeds in the composition of the herds at different heights above sea level. Figure 1
            illustrates
            how the Normande race predominates in the high altitudes of the Southwestern region of the department of
            Norte
            de Santander, however, it decreases as the altitude declines, being different between the fourth and the
            first quartile
            (P = 0.009). Conversely, the participation of Zebu genotypes (Gyr, Brahman) increases in the lowest quartile
            (first
            quartile), being different from the second quartiles (P = 0.03) and quartiles 3 and 4 (P = 0.0001).

        <p class="subtitulo">Milk Production </p>
        <p>
            The average milk production per cow per day for the southwestern region was 5.5 ± 0.2 L (Table 3). The
            highest
            levels of milk production were reported in the municipalities of Chitagá and Mutiscua (6.4 ± 0.6 and 6.1 ±
            0.4 L
            respectively), while the municipality of Pamplonita presented a lower value of 4.4 ± 0.4 L / cow * day (P =
            0.005).
        </p>

        <p>
            When organizing the data according to the size of the farm (Table 4), no differences were found (P = 0.41)
            between
            the milk production levels of systems of 10 or fewer animals (5.7 ± 0.3 L / cow * day, n = 54) compared with
            farms
            with more than 10 animals (5.3 ± 0.3 L / cow * day, n = 59). Similarly, when classifying the data by
            altitude quartiles
            (Table 5), there were no statistical differences regarding milk production (P &gt; 0.05).
        </p>


        <p class="subtitulo">Daily weight gain</p>
        <p>
            The average daily weight gains of the animals for the six municipalities analyzed was 367 ± 17 g / day. The
            DWG
            tended to be lower (P = 0.09) in small farms (1-10 animals, 336 ± 23.3 g / day, n = 46) compared to farms
            with more
            than 10 animals (393 ± 23.7 g / day, n = 53), while no differences between groups were found when comparing
            the
            quartiles of altitude.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Calving Interval
        </p>
        <p>
            The mean value for the CI variable was 405 ± 6.3 days (Table 3). The municipalities of Mutiscua, Silos, and
            Chitagá
            presented the best values for this parameter (fewer CI days) with 385, 387, and 390 days respectively, while
            the
            municipalities of Pamplona and Pamplonita presented the longest delay (P &gt; 0.05) for calving with 437 and
            444 days
            on average respectively (Table 3). When analyzing the data classified according to the size of the farms
            (number of
            animals, Table 4), the larger farms (&gt; 10 animals) had a lower average CI with 393 ± 5.5 days (n = 59),
            while in the
            small farms (1 to 10 animals), this value was higher (419 ± 11.4 days, n = 54; P = 0.04).
        </p>

        <p>
            The analysis of the data by altitude quartiles showed a progressive decrease in CI days as the altitude
            increases (Table
            5). There are differences (P = 0.01) between the first quartile, (altitudes between 1600 and 2300 MASL),
            that show a
            CI of 438 days, compared to quartile 4 that includes altitudes between 2800 to 3800 meters with a CI of 382
            days. For
            the CI variable, the results of the analysis by altitude quartiles are equivalent to the analysis by
            municipality, since
            the municipality located in the lowest altitude range obtained the highest CI values. On the other hand,
            there were
            differences when the data were analyzed according to the size of the farm.

        <p class="subtitulo">Use of artificial insemination
        </p>

        <p>
            Table 3 shows the percentages of use of artificial insemination in the municipalities of the region. There
            was a
            significant difference between a group of municipalities that presented a higher degree of AI use (Cacota
            66.7%, Silos
            50.0%, and Mutiscua 55.6%) compared to a second group with low implementation (Chitagá 14.8%, Pamplona
            13.6%,
            and Pamplonita 6.7%). It should be noted that in the case of the municipalities of Silos and Mutiscua, local
            policies
            contributed significantly to the increase in the percentages, while in the case of the municipality of
            Cacota the use of
            AI is self-iniative of the producers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding the semen used in the AI process, the use of 9 breeds was reported, 48.8% corresponding to
            specialized
            dairy breeds (Jersey 27.9%, Ayrshire 11.6%, and Holstein 9.3%), an additional 30.2% to European breeds
            recognized
            as dual-purpose (Normande 27.9%, Simmental 2.3%) and finally 21.0% to zebu breeds or their crosses (Gyr
            11.7%,
            Guzerá 4.7%, Girolando 2.3%, and Brahman 2.3%).
        </p>


        <p class="subtitulo">
            Producers' education
        </p>

        <p>
            The educational level of the surveyed producers was rated using an arbitrary scale established as follows: 0
            = The
            producer completed basic primary education, 1 = Secondary education completed, 2 = Higher education. For all
            the
            six municipalities, the highest percentage was in the lowest level of education (59.3%), followed by the
            intermediate
            (24.8%) and only 15.9% of the producers reported a higher level of education. The averages for the level of
            education
            are shown in table 3 and show the difference between the municipality with the highest (Cácota 0.93)
            compared to
            the two municipalities with the lowest levels of education (Pamplona and Pamplonita; 0.27 and 0.33
            respectively).
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Discussion</p>
        <p>
            In the development of the characterization of livestock in the southwestern region of Norte de Santander, a
            first factor
            to highlight was that despite being a relatively small area within the departmental geography (2347 Km2,
            10.8% of
            the department), there are differences in altitude among the six municipalities, and actually, within each
            municipality,
            a wide range of altitudes was found for the surveyed farms. Therefore, we decided to make an additional
            arrangement
            of the data using altitude quartiles, which allowed us to group farms with similar characteristics in the
            different
            municipalities.
        </p>

        <p>
            An added value of this research is the modification of the farm size classification used by the ICA [5], to
            ranges
            1-10, 11-50, and &gt;50 animals, which are more appropriately adjusted to the reality of the studied region
            and allow to
            visualize differential characteristics between the six municipalities, which otherwise would remain
            unnoticed (Table
            1)
        </p>

        <p>
            The bovine breeds present in the area are associated with the altitude ranges. The predominant breed in the
            entire
            study region was the Normande. A study carried out in the dairy micro-basin of the Antioquia highlands
            showed
            a higher proportion of the Holstein breed (83.5%) followed by Jersey (9.6%) and 6.9% corresponding to
            crosses of
            different breeds [7]. In the region of Paipa, Boyacá, Soler et al. [8] reported a higher proportion of the
            Normande
            breed, followed by the Holstein breed. It is important to highlight that in the first case the Antioquia
            region has
            specialized milk production while Boyaca is a region of subsistence production systems, more similar to
            those of the
            present study.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the first quartile of altitude, corresponding to the range between 1600 and 2300 MASL, the increase in
            the ratio of
            zebu (Brahman and Gyr) and crossbreed genotypes as the presence of Normande breed decreased was evident. The
            introduction of zebu crossbreeds adapted to high temperature, humidity, and ectoparasites conditions , is a
            practice
            established since the 1940s, to counteract the deleterious effects of the tropical environment in
            specialized breeds
            [9]. However, modern times have brought new challenges, such as the increase in the distribution of
            ectoparasites in
            higher altitude areas where previously they did not exist [10] and new alternatives, like the possibility of
            applying
            selection indexes that consider climatic characteristics in specialized breeds [11].
        </p>

        <p>
            The document on world statistics for artificial insemination in cattle published by Thibier and Wagner [12]
            reports
            the use of 53.2% of semen from specialized milk breeds, which coincides with the 48.8% reported in this
            survey.
            However, the use of semen from beef breeds is higher than dual-purpose breeds (39.2% vs 1.9% respectively)
            [12],
            a situation that was reversed in the region studied where only 2.4% use was reported for beef breeds
            (Brahman) and
            30.2% of dual-purpose breeds, mainly Normande. On the other hand, a high percentage of semen use from zebu
            breeds was found in the region (21%), which was surprising considering the altitude of the farms that
            reported such
            use (8/9 farms above 2300 MASL), and even more surprising two farms located above 3000 MASL, where the use
            of zebu breeds is very rare.
        </p>

        <p>
            In any case, the consolidated data indicate that, adding up the specialized breeds, the dual-purpose and
            those zebus
            that are promoted as milk producers in the tropics, 97.6% of the semen used in the region seeks improvement
            in milk
            production, , and only 2.4% (Brahman)is used for beef production. Together with the abovementioned, the
            presence
            of the Normande breed as the basis of the herd, is a general indicator of the productive trend of the
            region, which is
            the search for milk production plus marginal weight gains in the offspring, meaning dual-purpose systems.
        </p>


        <p>
            The milk production values found in the region were within the range of other studies conducted on
            dual-purpose
            systems similar to those in this research. Carulla and Ortega [13] determined values of 3 to 5 L / cow *day,
            while
            other authors report 3.34 L / cow *day [14], 7.7 L / cow * day [15] and 7.15 L / cow * day [16]. At similar
            altitudes to
            those of the present study, but under exclusive milk production systems, Hollman et al [17] reported
            productions of
            12.87 and Ramírez et al. [7] of 17.3 ± 6.3 liters / cow * day.
        </p>

        <p>
            The daily weight gains found in the region were lower than those reported by Soler et al. [8] in Boyacá
            (421g / day),
            559 g / day in zebu and Colombian creole crossbreed steers [18], and 788 g / day in creole Costeño con
            cuernos calves
            [19].
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the reasons for the high heterogeneity of the data regarding DWG is the breed composition and the
            type of
            production systems since the contribution of breeding systems for exclusive beef production in this
            particular region
            was low (3/113). According to this, the values found in the present work are lower than DWG in beef
            production
            systems with zebu cattle [20], where averages of 915g / animal / day can be reached with a diet based on
            mediumquality pastures, or in silvopastoral systems where gains between 800 and 980 g / animal / day were
            reported [21].
            Dual-purpose systems sacrifice calf growth in exchange for marginal volumes of milk. The results obtained
            indicate
            that in smaller farms (1-10 animals), the milk extraction pressure is greater, or similarly, that larger
            farms can apply
            a selection of animals with higher milk production and leave those cows of low production for free rearing
            without
            milking, favoring the growth of their calves. In other words, dual-purpose livestock systems present a wide
            spectrum
            of management between dairy systems and beef systems, which are modulated by management conditions, market
            and economic capacity of the producers.
        </p>

        <p>
            The CI found are lower than those reported by Bolívar et al [22], who found intervals equal to or greater
            than 460 days
            in Holstein, Jersey, and F1 (Holstein X Jersey) cows at an average height of 2490 MASL or as reported by
            Correa et at
            [23] 450.21 days in BON cows and 446.75 in Brahman cows. On the other hand, Botero et al [24] state that a
            420-day
            calving interval is considered good and that this parameter is influenced by genetics (adaptation), diet,
            management,
            environment, and suckling frequency.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is known that the variability of the postpartum period in cattle responds to multiple factors, mainly
            nutritional
            (energy balance - dam), and suckling (calf) [25]. The reproductive parameters, therefore, represent the
            consequence
            of multiple events of both the inputs of the productive systems such as environmental factors (altitude)
            related to
            nutritional factors (availability and quality of forages) as well as various management factors given by the
            type
            of operation and the degree of extraction that has already been mentioned in this type of dual-purpose
            systems. It
            is feasible to think that subsistence systems with lower supply and quality of forages with consequent
            nutritional
            imbalance, coupled with a maximum extraction of milk in detriment of the offspring, along with possible
            health
            issues, generate stressful conditions that result in the delay of reproductive function. Similarly, events
            associated with
            altitudes such as the breeds used, the quality of pastures, the incidence of diseases and parasites, can
            also lead to the
            reproductive parameters being punished in these areas.
        </p>

        <p>
            Regarding education, it is difficult to make a direct association of this variable with the productive
            parameters
            evaluated, although it is observed that the two municipalities with the lowest education index are also
            those in which
            artificial insemination is practiced the least. A study carried out by Díaz-Rivera et al [26] did not find
            an association
            between the level of education measured in years and meat and milk production parameters in dual-purpose
            systems in
            Mexico; However, they found that operations with a higher technological level produced higher quantities of
            meat per
            year, maintaining a milk production similar to traditional type productions. It is possible to think that
            comprehensive
            education and technical training policies are an adequate complement to technology transfer programs that
            involve
            genetic improvement and zootechnical management.

        <!-- Conclusiones -->
        <hr>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>
            The southwestern region of Norte de Santander has a dual-purpose livestock orientation with milk production
            of 5.5
            liters / cow * day and calf weight gains of 367 grams / day on average. The breed with the greatest presence
            is the
            Normande, particularly in areas located at higher altitudes (> 2300 MASL), below
            this altitude the percentages of other breeds such as Zebu (Brahman, Gyr) and their crosses with Holstein
            and other
            breeds increase.. Small farms (1 to 10 animals) predominate, followed by farms with no more than 50 animals
            and a
            minority of herds with more than 50 heads.
        </p>

        <p>
            Milk production did not present differences between farms of different sizes and altitudes in the six
            municipalities;
            however, the average was higher for the municipalities of Chitagá and Mutiscua compared to Pamplonita, which
            in
            turn is the town with the lowest average altitude.
        </p>

        <p>
            Regarding the weight gains of the offspring, these were similar for all municipalities and all altitudes,
            but there was
            a tendency for farms larger than 10 animals to obtain better daily weight gains. The intervals between
            calving are
            longer in Pamplona and Pamplonita and also in smaller farms and lower altitudes of all the municipalities
            studied.
            Future programs addressed to genetic improvement should consider the demand for females with potential for
            milk
            production and adequate weight gains in their offspring, using adequate breeds for the altitude conditions
        </p>

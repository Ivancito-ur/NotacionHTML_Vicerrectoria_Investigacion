                    This study shows a methodology for the detection, classification, and location of bearings that
                    presented ball faults, cage faults, and outer race faults. For this study, a three-phase induction
                    motor was used, in which the stator current and voltage signals were measured. By calculating the
                    total harmonic distortion and using the Stockwell Transform, different characteristics were obtained
                    in the electrical signals that allowed defining fault conditions in the bearing, classification of
                    the type of fault, and the location of the defective bearing (fan side or load side). By calculating
                    the difference between the total harmonic distortion of the current and voltage signal, it is
                    possible to identify a threshold value of 0.004 that separates a healthy condition and a fault
                    condition. The joint use of the Stockwell Transform and the Fisher Scoring Algorithm allows us to
                    classify the fault conditions with an average precision of 92.5%. The location of a bearing with
                    defects on the load side generates a greater amplitude in the signal compared to those located on
                    the fan side. This behavior allows establishing a threshold value of 1.6 for ball faults and 0.001
                    for cage faults and outer race. Due to the results obtained, the algorithm proposed in the study is
                    considered to be a tool with a high degree of reliability for the diagnosis of bearings in induction
                    motors.

                    Este estudio expone una metodología para la detección, clasificación y ubicación de fallas en
                    rodamientos de bola, en la jaula y la pista exterior. Para este estudio se utilizó un motor de

                    Calculando la distorsión armónica total y utilizando la Transformada de Stockwell, se obtuvieron
                    diferentes características en las señales eléctricas que permitieron definir las condiciones de
                    falla en el rodamiento, la clasificación del tipo de falla y la ubicación del rodamiento defectuoso
                    (lado ventilador o lado carga). Calculando la diferencia entre la distorsión armónica total de la
                    señal de corriente y voltaje, es posible identificar un valor de umbral de 0.004 que separa una
                    condición de operación normal y una condición de falla. El uso de la Transformada de Stockwell y el
                    algoritmo de puntuación de Fisher nos permite clasificar las condiciones de falla con una precisión
                    promedio del 92.5%. La ubicación de un rodamiento con defectos en el lado de carga genera una mayor
                    amplitud en la señal, en comparación con los ubicados en el lado del ventilador. Este comportamiento
                    permite establecer un valor umbral de 1.6 para fallas de bola y 0.001 para fallas en la jaula y en
                    la pista exterior. Por los resultados obtenidos, el algoritmo propuesto en el estudio se considera
                    una herramienta con un alto grado de confiabilidad para el diagnóstico de rodamientos en motores de
                    inducción.

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction </p>

        <p>Electric induction motors are used repeatedly in industry, commerce, and the tertiary sector due to the
            advantages they possess, such as robustness, complete structure, easy control, and reliability [1] - [4]. In
            spite of having a relatively uncomplicated structure, induction motors are still exposed to different types
            of faults, including end ring faults, bearings, manufacturing defects, and broken rotor bars [5] - [9].
            These faults can be associated with grounding problems, overloads, phase desynchronization, short circuits,
            and asymmetrical power supply [5], [10] - [14].</p>

        <div class="image">

        </div>

        <p>The appearance of motor faults causes irregular operation, which leads to energy losses and increased
            maintenance work, which increases the economic costs of keeping the motor running. This shows the importance
            of early detection of faults in induction motors [1].</p>
        <p>Among the most commonly used induction motors are squirrel cage motors. The types of faults that occur can be
            grouped into external and internal faults. Figure 1 shows a list of these two groups [15], [16].</p>
        <p>In general, induction motors are exposed to high-temperature environments, corrosion, and mechanical stress.
            These conditions favor the development of incipient faults that are difficult to detect. This type of
            incipient fault does not cause a relevant problem to the engine. However, over time it can get worse and
            cause the engine to stop completely. Therefore, there is a need for methodologies that allow for monitoring
            conditions and early detection of faults.</p>
        <p>In addition to energy losses, studies indicate that motor faults cause a greater tendency to experimental
            oscillations, voltage and current imbalances, power reduction, and overheating. Figure 2 shows the most
            common types of faults in induction motors [17].</p>

        <div class="image">

        <p>As shown in Figure 2, the bearings are the main fault in the motors. These faults are associated with broken
            cages, inner race, outer race, eroded balls, and among others. In general, vibration analysis is the
            technique used for bearing fault detection [18], [19]. This type of analysis requires the use of vibration
            transducers and modules, which makes it a costly analysis. An alternative is the motor current signature
            analysis (MCSA) since it only requires current measurements. In the case of the MCSA, the use of the Fourier
            Transform provides current signal spectrum information as a function of frequency for fault detection [20].
            The spectral characteristic analysis is used for fault detection in multi-agent systems [21], [22]. Fast
            Fourier Transform (FFT) is the most frequently used tool for spectral analysis. However, it provides
            information without a time position, which can make the diagnosis of faults difficult.</p>
        <p>More advanced signal processing techniques involving frequency and time domain can be used to overcome the
            shortcomings of FFT [23]. These techniques include the Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT), the
            Hilbert-Huang Transform, the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD), and the Wavelet Transform (WT) [24], [25]. The
            techniques using STFT and WVD are limited by the presence of cross-terms and fixed window sizes. However,
            the WT technique overcomes these limitations. Therefore, the latter has been investigated to replace
            diagnostics based on current and vibration signals.</p>
        <p>The Stockwell Transform (ST) is an enhancement of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), which allows for
            more information in the specific frequency bands. Several investigations have used ST in distribution
            systems using renewable energy sources and in transformer protection systems [26], [27]. Research by Singh
            and Shaik [28] shows that by analyzing the ST, it is possible to diagnose bearing faults. In this
            investigation, a methodology is proposed for the detection, classification, and location of bearings that
            presented ball faults, cage faults, and outer race faults. For this study, a three-phase induction motor was
            used, in which the stator current and voltage signals were measured, which were analyzed by calculating the
            total harmonic distortion and using the Stockwell Transform.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Experimental bench description </p>

        <p>For the experimental study, a 380V, 4-pole, 50Hz, three-phase induction motor was used. The motor shaft is
            supported by two types of bearings, 6205 and 6204, which are located on the load side and on the fan side.
            The motor characteristics are shown in Table I. A multimeter, a current module, and a voltage module were
            used to measure the electrical parameters of the motor. The measuring instruments are connected to a
            computer for the recording and subsequent analysis of the data. Figure 3 shows the connection diagram of the
            experimental bench of the motor.</p>

        <div class="image">

        </div>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-11/img4.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Three types of faults were selected for the study of bearing problems; cage fault, ball fault, and outer race
            fault. For each type of fault, 10 bearings were used to obtain the experimental samples. Additionally,
            experimental tests were carried out with 10 new bearings.</p>



        <p class="subtitulo"> Experimental methodology </p>

        <p>The measured stator currents for each test condition are analyzed in two ways. For the first analysis, the
            Fast Fourier Transform is used to identify the bearings that show some type of fault. Subsequently, the
            Stockwell Transformation is used to classify each type of bearing fault. Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)
            analysis was used to compare healthy and faulty bearings. With the use of the Stockwell Transformation, the
            characteristics of each type of fault are analyzed based on the statistical information of the magnitude and
            phase graphs.</p>
        <p>The information about the characteristics of each test obtained with the analysis by FFT and ST are unified
            to build a matrix. The characteristics obtained are classified using the Fisher Score algorithm. The
            functions are then sent to a support vector machine (SVM) for function identification. The algorithm used in
            the present study consists mainly of three steps; fault detection, function selection for fault type
            identification, and fault bearing position location (fan side or load side).</p>



        <p class="subtitulo">Fault detection</p>

        <p>To identify whether a bearing is in a healthy or fault condition, the total harmonic distortion is calculated
            using the FFT. The calculation obtained is compared with a reference value obtained from tests with healthy
            bearings. The calculation of this fault factor is shown in equation (1).</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-11/img5.jpg" height="100px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>By means of the Stockwell transformation, a matrix was constructed consisting of rows representing changes in
            time and columns representing changes in frequency. Different statistical parameters are calculated from the
            data collected from the matrix.</p>
        <p>Fisher's scoring criteria are used to classify the different characteristics. Because three types of bearing
            faults are studied, two SVM is used, identified as SVM-A and SVM-B. The fault identification scheme using
            the SVM is shown in Figure 4.</p>

            <img src="img/V25-N3-11/img6.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>


        <p class="subtitulo">Fault bearing position location</p>

        <p>A bearing with a fault condition can be located on the fan side or on the load side of the motor. Two
            parameters are used to identify the location of the bearing, depending on the type of fault. In the case of
            ball faults, the maximum magnitude is calculated using equation (2).</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-11/img7.jpg" height="100px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Similarly, for the outer race fault and the cage fault, the maximum phase angle is calculated using equation
            (3).</p>


        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-11/img8.jpg" height="95    px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>The parameters calculated with equations (1) and (2) are compared with the respective threshold values.
            Figure 5 shows the scheme of the algorithm used in this study.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Bearing fault detection</p>

        <p>Figure 6 shows the Fast Fourier transform of the stator current signal for healthy bearings and those with
            cage defects.</p>


        <div class="image">

        </div>

        <p>It is observed that the presence of the bearing fault tends to produce signals with higher amplitudes along
            the frequency spectrum. However, the results obtained from the Fast Fourier Transform do not allow a clear
            determination of the healthy and fault condition. To solve this problem, the fault index (F1) is calculated,
            which was described in equation (1). With this fault index, the two bearing conditions are again compared.
            This comparison is shown in Figure 7.</p>



        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-11/img11.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>By calculating the fault index (F1), an undeniable difference was observed between a bearing with a defect
            and a healthy one. The results show that the amplitude of the signal in the fault condition is six times
            greater than the healthy state. Due to these results, the fault index (F1) is recognized as a key tool to
            detect the presence of faults. In order to assess the capacity of the fault index (F1), the three bearing
            defects are individually compared to healthy conditions. The results obtained are shown in Figure 8.</p>



        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V25-N3-11/img12.jpg" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Figure 8 shows the fault index (F1) of the 10 bearings in each category (healthy, ball fault, cage fault, and
            outer race fault). Each of these defects produces a different range in signal amplitude. For the ball, cage,
            and outer race faults, mean amplitudes of 0.012, 0.014, and 0.011 were observed. However, for the healthy
            condition, the variability of the signal amplitude was less compared to the fault conditions. In all health
            conditions, the amplitude remained close to 0.004. Furthermore, in no-fault condition was the signal
            amplitude less than or equal to 0.004. Due to these two characteristics, it is possible to consider this
            value as a threshold for the detection of bearings with defects.</p>


        <p class="subtitulo">Selection of the main features of the signal</p>

        <p>The collected characteristics of the 40 bearings are grouped into two databases. The first base is used to
            feed the SVM-A, and the second is used in the SVM-B. For testing, a linear SVM is chosen since it allows a
            higher speed of convergence and requires a lower computational cost.</p>
        <p>By using the five characteristics shown in Table II, it was possible to achieve 95% accuracy in identifying
            ball fault or other types of fault. Figure 9 shows the accuracy of the SVM-A for different combinations of
            the five characteristics. In this case, 95% accuracy is achieved with a combined level of 335.</p>

        <p>Similarly, in the case of the SVM-B, a maximum precision of 90% was obtained with the use of the three
            characteristics shown in Table III. This precision allows the identification of cage fault or outer race
            fault. Figure 10 shows that 90% accuracy is achieved with a combined level of 60.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Faulty bearing location</p>

        <p>The last step of the algorithm proposed in this study is to determine the location of the bearing that has
            the fault, which may be located on the fan side or on the load side of the motor. In this case, the
            calculation of the two-fault index (F2 and F3) is performed depending on the type of defect. These
            calculations are based on equations (1) and (2) previously described. Figure 11 shows the fault index
            calculation (F2) for ball faults</p>

        <div class="image">

        </div>

        <p>The results obtained show that the bearings located on the fan sideshow appreciably less signal amplitude.
            This amplitude varied in a narrow range of 1.57-1.60. Therefore, the value of 1.60 was established as a
            threshold value that would allow defining the location of the faulty bearing. Similarly, the fault index
            calculation (F3) is used to locate bearings with cage faults and outer race faults. The results obtained are
            shown in Figure 12.</p>

        <p>A behavior similar to that obtained in Figure 11 was observed. The signal amplitude is considerably greater
            for defective bearings located on the load side of the motor. In this case, a value of 0.001 can be
            considered as a threshold to locate the faulty bearing.</p>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>This article investigates a method of detecting, classifying, and locating the bearings of a three-phase
            induction motor that exhibits defects related to ball faults, cage faults, and outer race faults. The study
            method is based on an algorithm that analyzes the signals obtained from the Fast Fourier Transform and the
            Stockwell Transform. These signals were collected by measuring the current and voltage of the motor stator.
        </p>
        <p>The characteristics of the electrical signals are strongly influenced by the presence of bearing faults. This
            can be verified by comparing the amplitudes of the signals calculated by FFT for a healthy and faulty
            condition. However, this type of analysis is not sufficient to detect defective bearings with high
            reliability. The results obtained show that, by calculating the difference between the total harmonic
            distortion of the current and voltage signal, it is possible to identify a threshold value of 0.004 that
            separates the healthy condition from the three fault states analyzed.</p>
        <p>Using the Stockwell Transform, it is possible to generate a set of characteristics that can be classified
            using Fisher's Scoring Algorithm. The joint use of these two tools allows us to feed algorithms such as SVM
            to classify ball faults, cage faults, and outer race faults. With the use of this classification method, the
            accuracy of between 90% - 95% is achieved.</p>
        <p>The maximum magnitude and maximum phase angle allow the location of the faulty bearing to be identified. In
            the case of the three faults studied, it was shown that the location of a bearing with defects on the load
            side generates a greater amplitude in the signal. This behavior allows establishing a threshold value of 1.6
            for ball faults and 0.001 for cage faults and outer race. Due to the results obtained, it is concluded that
            the algorithm proposed in the study is a tool that can be used with a high degree of reliability for the
            diagnosis of the condition of the bearings.</p>

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction </p>

        <p>Livestock production in Colombia uses monoculture grazing of grasses to feed cattle; This makes that
            production system dependent on high amounts of external inputs such as balanced food, fertilizers,
            agrochemicals, fuels, etc.</p>

        <p>Colombia is a country with an exuberant biological diversity, in which you can find numerous species of trees
            and shrubs (native or introduced) such as T divesifolia and S. nigra. These are adapted to tropical
            conditions and have a high potential used as feed for cattle due to their agronomic characteristics and
            nutritional composition, which can exceed the contributions made by foreign grasses.</p>

        <p>Taking this into account, the establishment of silvopastoral systems (SSP) proposed as a strategy to
            intensify livestock production sustainably, taking advantage of the benefits provided by tree and shrub
            species such as contribution to the reduction of maintenance and fertilizer costs. These obtain products
            such as poles, wood, firewood, fruits and foliage that animals consume, reduces the impact of trampling,
            reduces erosion, increases moisture retention, promotes the return of wildlife, increases carbon deposits,
            reduces emissions of methane because they contribute to improving the efficiency of metabolic processes in
            the rumen of cattle, among others <a href="#r1">[1]</a>, <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.</p>

        <p>Several tasks are contemplated in the establishment and management of the (SSP), among these are the
            uniformization prunings that aim to homogenize the plants for the beginning of grazing or when these are too
            tall and the animal does not reach or is not comfortable consuming it <a href="#r3">[3]</a>. The product is
            most of the time
            delivered to the ground as green manure <a href="#r4">[4]</a>.</p>

        <p>In tropical conditions, it is difficult to maintain a constant forage production specifically due to the
            marked difference between the rainy and dry season, which makes it necessary to create food reserves for use
            in times of drought <a href="#r5">[5]</a>. The uniformization prunings generated during the establishment of
            the SSP can be an
            essential food to preserve it through the silage technique mixed with other plant sources as a mechanism to
            improve its initial condition offered to animals in times of food scarcity.</p>

        <p>Silage seeks to maintain the initial nutritional characteristics of the material to be preserved, for this,
            strategies such as inoculation with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used to improve lactic fermentation, but
            the effects of said inoculants on the quality of the silage and the productive performance of the animals
            are not clear <a href="#r6">[6]</a>.</p>

        <p>The objective of this work was to evaluate the nutritional composition of the silage made from the material
            collected from the uniformization pruning from an intensive browsing SSP with the species of the buttercup
            (Tithonia diversifolia) and linden (Sambucus nigra). These species mix in different proportions with sugar
            cane (Saccharum officinarum) and King Grass (Pennisetum hybridum) using commercial additive of lactic acid
            bacteria and rumination.</p>

        <!-- Metodología y materiales -->
        <hr>

        <p class="titulo">Materials and methods
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> Origin of plant material </p>

        <p>The plant material used to make the silos was obtained from a browsing silvopastoral system established at
            the SENA
            Center for Renewable Natural Resources La Salada. It is located in the Municipality of Caldas Antioquia, Km
            6 via
            la Pintada (6°02'57.6"N 75°37'30.6"W), at 1900 masl, with an average temperature of 18 ° C, a rainfall of
            3800 mm /
            year, and a relative humidity of 85%, sandy clay loam soil, pH = 5.74 moderately acid. The establishment of
            the SSP
            system was carried out in June 2016, in an area of 1 ha-1, composed of three strata: 1- arboreal stratum
            composed
            of alder trees (Alnus acuminata). These were planted at a distance of 10 m between rows and 4 m between
            trees, 2-
            shrub stratum composed of buttercup plants (Tithonia diversifolia) planted in rows every 3 and continuously
            between
            plants and linden (Sambucus nigra) sown in rows every 3 meters and 50 cm between plants and 3- a herbaceous
            layer
            composed of star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis).</p>


        <p class="subtitulo">Cutting, transport and chopping of the material </p>

        <p>After four months, a radical pruning was carried out, from the primary stems at a height between 70-80 cm
            from the ground to the button and linden plants. This material was used to make the silage. King Grass and
            sugarcane were harvested at an age of 2.5 months and 11 months respectively. The cutting and transport of
            the forage to the processing area was carried out manually and there it was fractionated in a pasture pick
            with an approximate particle size of between 2 and 2.5 cm. Samples collected from King grass, forage cane
            and button and linden pruning were used to determine the initial nutritional composition through the near
            infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique, in the animal nutrition laboratory of the Universidad de Antioquia
            and in the Eurofins Agro NL laboratory (Holland) through the U of A agreement – DaryCaB.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Preparation of additives </p>

        <p>Ruminal enzyme extract (ruminasse) and a commercial product are used as an additive for the production of
            silage, the latter composed of lactic acid bacteria. (Lactobacillus Plantarum, Lactobacillus Brevis,
            Pediococcus Acidilactici y Streptococcus Diacetylactis), The dose used was 1g dissolved in half a liter of
            water without chlorine at room temperature, shaking it slightly, for each 10 kg silo.</p>

        <p>Rumination was obtained from cattle slaughtered in a processing plant, it was transported to the place where
            the test
            was prepared in an anaerobic environment,1kg (solid and liquid phase) was used for each 10 kg silo.</p>


        <p class="subtitulo">Silage preparation </p>

        <p>Six treatments were evaluated: T1: 25% button + 25% linden + 50% cane with commercial additive (BTCac), T2:
            T1 with rumination (BTCru), T3: 25% button + 25% linden + 50% + king grass with commercial additive (BTPac),
            T4:</p>

        <p>T3 with ruminased (BTPru) T5: 25% button + 25% linden + 25% cane + 25% king grass with commercial additive
            (BTCPac), T6: T5 with ruminased (BTCPru). After having the material in the processing area, it was weighed
            and mixed, adding the inoculum according to the indicated treatment, it was packed in six-gauge silage bags,
            compacted manually and each silo was wrapped in a plastic film, storing it later, in a place protected from
            humidity and sun, for a period of 31 days. 5 repetitions were carried out for each treatment, when opening

        <p class="subtitulo">Dry material</p>


        <p>This variable did not present a significant difference between treatments, or between additives, or
            interaction between treatment and additive, with a general average of 16.54%, a value that is below that
            reported by Hidalgo et al <a href="#r7">[7]</a>, who is a nutritional evaluation and sensory silage of
            Sorghum vulgare and
            Tithonia diversifolia. In a proportion of 75% and 25%, respectively, they found a DM of 30%, this may be
            because the material in the present study was not subjected to a pre-drying process, in addition to the
            additives used (rumination and commercial inoculum of BAL), were prepared in a humid environment, which
            could have increased the humidity levels of the conserved material. On the contrary, Gastón <a
                href="#r8">[8]</a> obtained a
            DM level of 12.7% in silage of leaves and non-woody stems of Tithonia diversifolia after 35 days of
            fermentation.</p>

        <p>The ideal dry matter concentration in silage depends on the material to be conserved <a href="#r9">[9]</a>,
            some authors report
            that said value for tropical forages can be between 17 and 30% <a href="#r10">[10]</a>, <a
                href="#r11">[11]</a>, and this parameter can be
            improved by adding absorbent additives like straw, although there is a risk of diminishing the nutritional
            value by dilution <a href="#r12">[12]</a>.</p>


        <p class="subtitulo">Ashes</p>

        <p>In this parameter, there was a statistical difference between treatments and not between additives and there
            was no
            treatment / additive interaction.</p>

        <p>The treatments that differed were BTCPac, BTCPru, and BTPac BTPru from BTCac and BTCru, the latter two
            showing the lowest value (11.77% average). This could be due to the low initial ash content (8.20%) in the
            sugarcane, which is found to constitute 50% of the ensiled biomass. Ash values of 8% are reported by Suárez
            et al <a href="#r13">[13]</a>, in silages of the burnt bud of sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum) and
            matarratón (Gliricidia
            sepium), in proportions of 75/25% respectively. The values found in the present study being higher in all
            treatments (13.59% general average), likewise Carvajal and Cuesta <a href="#r14">[14]</a>, report values of
            11.03% for silages
            of Sambucus nigra added with 5% cane molasses.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Crude protein</p>

        <p>In this variable, there was no significant difference between treatments or between additives, or interaction
            between
            additive and treatment.</p>

        <p>PC contents fluctuated between 9.20% and 13.07% and had a general average of 10.7%. This value is below that
            reported by Blanco at al <a href="#r15">[15]</a>, who found a protein content of 13.77%, for silage made
            from S. nigra, A.
            decurrens and A. satiava and molasses, using enzymatic extract from ruminal fluid as additive. This low
            value may be because some conserved materials such as grass Pennisetum hybridum in the initial state they
            had very low levels of protein (6.97%). In addition to biomass from the shrubs was an average 4.5 months old
            at the uniformization cut, taking into account that the effect of maturity in these species causes a
            decrease in nutritional quality.</p>

        <p>However, some authors such as Suárez et al <a href="#r13">[13]</a> obtained lower values than those reported
            in the present
            study (5.95%) when ensiling burnt bud of sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum) and matarratón (Gliricidia
            sepium), in proportions of 75/25% respectively.</p>

        <p>Other factors that could be associated with levels of CP found are the collection of the material to be
            ensiled, so, rapid proteolysis begins. When the pH does not fall below 4.2 and the humidity conditions in
            the silage are high as in the present study, it is highly probable that the population of clostridium and
            the production of butyric acid will increase. Clostridium are proteolytic that degrade the protein to amino
            acids so that a decrease in this can be perceived in the ensiled material. This can be controlled by
            carrying out a rapid pre-drying process of the material <a href="#r9">[9]</a>, <a href="#r12">[12]</a>, or
            using additives such as formic acid,
            which can increase the amount of protein promoting an increase in the performance of the animals. This being
            attributed to the better balance of amino acids and the suppression of proteolysis by control of proteolytic
            bacteria and plant enzymes <a href="#r16">[16]</a>.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Neutral detergent fiber </p>

        <p>In this variable, a significant difference was found between additives, but not between treatments or
            interaction
            between additive and treatment.</p>

        <p>The general average was 59.24%, the lowest value was 56.68% in the BTCac treatment without statistical
            difference. This value is higher than that found in silages of Tithonia diversifolia and Pennisetum
            purpureum, (31,43 %) in a proportion of 20/80 respectively, using a commercial additive in a quantity of 4%,
            <a href="#r17">[17]</a>. It is below that reported by Echeverria et al <a href="#r18">[18]</a>, who found in
            silage made from Olea pruning
            European, an NDF level of 66.87% at 110 days of fermentation.
        </p>

        <p>The NDF values depend on the maturity of the crop, the genotype, the diversity of the soil, and the use of
            additives, in the case of this study the materials were of advanced age, which produced a high NDF value in
            the silage.</p>


        <p class="subtitulo">Lignin </p>

        <p>This parameter presented a significant difference between treatments and additive treatment interaction, but
            there was no difference between additives. The treatments that differed were BTCac and BTCPru with values of
            5.1% and 7.5% respectively and the treatments BTCac and BTPru and BTPac, with average values of 5.1%, 6.8%
            and 7.6 respectively.</p>

        <p>The general average for this variable was 6.56%, a value that is below that reported by Echeverria et al
            <a href="#r18">[18]</a>, who found in silage made from prunings of European Olea, with 110 days of
            fermentation a value of
            24,4%.
        </p>
        <p>The lowest levels of lignin were present in the BTCac and BTCru treatments. In comparison with other grasses
            and legumes, sugarcane has a low level of lignin in the NDF, which may represent the low total levels of
            lignin in the treatment, although on the other hand, the negative effect of this phenolic compound on fiber
            digestibility can be more pronounced than in other plants <a href="#r19">[19]</a>. The low nanoporosity of
            the cane, especially
            in the most lignified areas affects the composition of the cell wall, besides, the formation of a
            sclerenchyma ring in the stem cortex hinders the transformation of the particles, increasing the rumen
            retention time, which explains the greater physical effectiveness of FDN <a href="#r9">[9]</a>.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">pH </p>

        <p>This variable presented a significant difference between treatments and there was no difference between
            additives or additive treatment interaction. The treatments BTCac and BTCru showed a significant difference
            with BTCPac, BTCPru and BTPac, BTPru.</p>

        <p>The general average was 4.5. The pH level in the present study is in the ideal range of 3.8 to 5.0 reported
            by Merry et al <a href="#r20">[20]</a>, which indicates an adequate fermentation of the forage mass. The
            average pH determined
            in the treatments with both additives is slightly above that found by Carvajal and Cuesta <a
                href="#r14">[14]</a> with a pH of
            4.28 in linden silage in 30 days of fermentation.</p>

        <p>The decrease in the pH levels at the beginning of the ensilage process is essential to avoid the increase of
            proteolytic microorganisms. This level is largely promoted by the concentration of highly fermentable
            carbohydrates such as those provided by the cane and the microbiota present in the dough forage to be
            conserved <a href="#r9">[9]</a>, which is why the lower values in the treatments with 50% sugarcane can be
            explained.</p>

        <p>Low pH levels in silage are generally associated with depressions in the intake and poor use of fiber, since
            at low pH in the rumen cellulolytic activity decreases, however, said pH is neutralized in the mouth by the
            action of the saliva at the time of consumption. [21].</p>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>Taking into account the results in the present study, the residues of the uniformization pruning generated in
            the establishment of silvopastoral systems, have a potential use mixed with materials such as sugarcane to
            be conserved through the silage technique to solve the deficiencies of forage in critical times. Rumination
            is presented as a material with potential for use as an additive in the conservation of forages because the
            action of this in the conservation of the material was similar to that of the commercial inoculum that has a
            high cost, on the contrary, rumination it is an item that is easily accessible and its commercial value is
            low.</p>

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>

        <p>Education is one of the fundamental pillars on which the different nations have focused to generate their
            development, that is why it is shown as the differential factor in each of the societies at local, national
            and global levels, so the constant advances in methodologies focused on teaching are present very often, but
            have wondered how engineering education has evolved and what role is occupying today.</p>

        <p>Natural Sciences, Engineering and Technology are two of the great areas of knowledge declared by the
            Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD whose mission is to design better policies for a
            better life, these great areas are also part of the daily growth of society due to its great advances over
            time in science, technology and innovation and the promise of better future developments, so the study and
            transfer of knowledge in these areas is positioned as a challenge to achieve constant scientific advances.
        </p>

        <p>The methodology of education based on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) has taken an
            interesting role in the classroom to promote project-based learning, case studies, etc., also encouraging
            the development of soft skills in primary and secondary education by encouraging the study of science and
            engineering in undergraduate and graduate education. Therefore, this document will address issues such as
            STEM applications in the areas of knowledge mentioned, and how these have generated impact in different
            regions both nationally and internationally applications that have emerged through remote laboratories
            studied by the authors M.I. Alberto Pedro Lorandi Medina, M.I. Guillermo Herminda saba, M.S.I. José
            Hernández Silva and M. C Enrique Ladrón de Guevara Duran, educational kits and tools for electronics,
            robotics, natural sciences and even aerospace engineering as mentioned by authors D. López - Fernández, P.
            Salgado - Sánchez , I.Tinao and V.Lapuerta in the article named Challenge-Based Learning in Aerospace
            Engineering Education: The ESA Concurrent Engineering Challenge at the Technical University of Madrid etc,
            focusing that STEM education is the force to promote the acquisition of knowledge for the future workforce.

        <p class="titulo">Materials and methods
        </p>

        <p>This study deepens and emphasizes the search and confrontation of theories and/or methodologies concerning
            the subject of advances and applications of engineering education through the technique of study of Science,
            Technology, Engineering and Mathematics STEM and subsequent documentary exploration, which will be
            implemented for the study and comparison of theories, activities etc. Applied in the STEM field.

        <p>The execution of the research was developed in the exploratory scope, examining the field of engineering
            education
            applying the STEM methodology following as a pattern the sequence of development described in Figure 1.</p>

        <p>The study of each of the advances and/or applications is carried out by means of a characterization of the
            information, referring to the topic of the objectives, methods, results and conclusions with the purpose of
            clarifying the panorama of the research carried out in order to guide the development of this work in a
            clear and coherent manner.</p>

        <p>Therefore, by means of the sequence described in figure 1, the topics will be approached as shown in figure
            2.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Theoretical Frame</p>

        <p>Apropos R N Irfiandaru, Abdurrahman and N Nurulsari in 2020, the learning process should be integrated with
            the scientific approach. In learning, the scientific approach is a feature and becomes a strength, and there
            needs to be the development of STEM-based teaching materials to support learning. STEM is an effective
            approach because it combines four disciplines, including science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
            Improving students' understanding of STEM is the key to success in raising student achievement in
            California. The use of STEM integration is proven to increase students' interest in learning in school,
            however the challenges in STEM education are not just technology, but teachers must be prepared to use the
            STEM approach. [1]</p>

        <p>On the other hand, Kustina, Suratno and D Wahyuni in 2020 mention that biotechnology is a field of science
            that develops from a scientific interest, being very important to be understood by students because of its
            impact and potential on them and others. In honing students' skills in biology, especially biotechnology
            materials require learning that can help students improve their integrated knowledge with technology. Now,
            STEM education has been developed to be improving students' skills and it is very suitable if it is
            collaborated with biotechnology materials. STEM is an education that started to be seen by the government
            and educators in preparing the students needed in the future. [2] STEM education has been developed to
            improve students' skills and it is very suitable if collaborated with biotechnology materials.</p>

        <p>The following researchers such as Elli J. Theobalda, Mariah J. Hilla, Elisa Trana, Sweta Agrawalb, E. Nicole
            Arroyoc, Shawn Behlingd, Nyasha Chambwee, Dianne Laboy Cintróna, Jacob D. Coopera, Gideon Dunstera, Jared
            A. Grummera, Kelly Hennesseya, Jennifer Hsiaoa, Nicole Iranonf, Leonard Jones, Hannah Jordta, Marlowe
            Kellera, Melissa E. Laceya, Caitlin E. Littlefieldd, Alexander Lowea, Shannon Newmang,h, Vera Okoloa,
            Savannah Olroyda, Brandon R. Peecooka, Sarah B. Picketti, David L. Slagera, Itzue W. Caviedes-Solisa,
            Kathryn E. Stanchaka, Vasudha Sundaravardanj, Camila Valdebenitoa, Claire R. Williamsk, Kaitlin Zinslia, and
            Scott Freemana mention that in 2019, a recent meta-analysis concluded that, on average, active learning in
            STEM leads to higher test scores and lower failure rates for all students

            compared to all students in the same courses delivered through traditional lectures. However, several
            reports from biology, undergraduate courses also suggest that innovative course designs with active learning
            can reduce or even eliminate achievement gaps for MGS. [3]</p>

        <p>However, Garousi Vahid, Giray Görkem, Tüzün Eray, Catal Cagatay, and Michael Felderer mention that in 2019
            many software engineering graduates often face difficulties when starting their careers, which is mainly due
            to the mismatch of skills learned at university with what is needed in the software industry. The main
            objective is to perform a meta-analysis to aggregate the results of published studies in this area to
            provide a consolidated view on how to align software engineering education with industry needs, to identify
            the most important skills and also the existing knowledge gaps. [4]

        <p>From another circumstance the National University of Malaysia in 2019 unveils in its science, technology,
            engineering and mathematics (STEM) outreach report led by Sabirin Abdullah, Gan Kok Beng, Mardina Abdullah,
            Lilia Halim, Roslinda Rosli, Nurul Hajijah Hair, Muhamad Roszaini Roslan, Noridawaty Mat Daud, Mohd Azlan
            Shah Jaafar and Norisza Dalila Ismail where Selangor school students learned how to use an Arduino coding
            program to control mini helicopters. The students were instructed on how to assemble a simple circuit for
            the control system and how the circuit was connected to a microcontroller, which communicate with the
            computer. This equipped the students with basic knowledge to make the right program to move the helicopter.
            All learning activities were greatly facilitated by the undergraduate students through a teaching module. In
            addition, the program was conducted in the form of competition and this helped to bring out the
            competitiveness within the students. As a result, students were able to
            gain new knowledge within a short period of time. [5]</p>

        <p>Continuing with robotics Habib Ahmed and Hung Manh La in 2019 indicate that the integration between robotics
            and education is essential to promote education and knowledge acquisition, which will lead to the training
            and development of the workforce of the future, thus exposing in their paper the exploration of the primary
            aspects related to education and robotics; one that seeks to utilize robotics education, primarily for
            science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) related courses and another that discusses the use
            of different robots in the broader context for the purpose of facilitating education and learning for
            students of all ages. The proposal has implications at the national level, policy development in relation to
            STEM education, skills development at the professional level, as well as robotics education at the
            institutional level. [6]</p>

        <p>In addition, Rodrigo Canek, Yeisson Chicas and Oscar Rodas in 2019 state that in the United States and
            Guatemala there is a shortage of engineers to be hired. Universities are not preparing enough students who
            choose scientific, technological, engineering or mathematical (STEM) areas as their career path. Our
            proposed outreach program has shown that participation in international and national robotics student
            competitions can ensure up to 75% of those students decide for a professional occupation in a STEM career
            path. [7]</p>

        <p>On the other hand, Veronica Farr and Gerri Ligth in 2019 mentions that drone industries present a rich
            ecosystem for STEM careers; thus STEM development integrated the Drone Innovators Program, designed to
            immerse middle and high school students in STEM careers through drone education. The course design utilizes
            modeling research-based instruction to capture a wide range of student interests, skills, and abilities.[8]
        </p>

        <p>Eric Nersesian, Adam Spryszynski, and Micahel J. Lee in 2019 comment on educational technologies (ET),
            monitoring bases (MB), and virtual reality (VR), applications that show promise for improving education. In
            their study they compared MB and VR technologies as alternatives for supplemental classroom learning through
            lectures, textbooks, and physics labs.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, this research project serves as a basis to determine whether TEs have the potential to engage
            students.[9] In turn Tiago Lobato de Souza and Larissa Sato Elisiario in 2019 focused on the possibility of
            exploring the experience in educational robotics classes with Arduino and 3D printing for children and
            adolescents aged 10 to 17, they emphasize these two tools that can be very useful together to teach basic
            science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) concepts. [10]</p>

        <p>Dwight Bues in 2019 indicates that engineers often need to present a design and implementation proposals,
            speaking in front of a group. STEM students may be reluctant to publicly discuss their ideas and could use
            good role models, as this will definitely improve their performance in college and the business world. To a
            large extent, engineers have the math and science background to be subject matter experts, useful to be able
            to advise students within the particular STEM pursuit, this with the goal of helping engineers to "come out
            of their shells" by giving pointers on the methods and pitfalls of various types of instruction. [11]</p>

        <p>Bryan Choate, Mia Dubosarsky, and Katherine Chen propose in 2018 innovative professional development (PD) for
            teaching robotics to educators with little or no robotics experience. Despite rapidly growing opportunities
            for K-12 students to participate in robotics, challenges, and competitions, too few robotics professionals
            have development opportunities, leaving educators unprepared to guide and coach their students. To address
            the need, the STEM Education Center at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) developed the Robotics for
            Educators program, a 5-day robotics program experience for K-12 educators in formal and informal settings.
            In the program's unique format, students and teachers learn together, participate in the same challenges,
            and assist each other in designing and programming robots. [12]</p>

        <p>Likewise, Chanjin Chung and Elmer Santos in 2018 came up with a robot festival called Robofest being an
            informal learning program with multiple challenge learning interactives where students are challenged to
            complete robotics tasks. One approach that highlights this robotics carnival is that instead of professional
            technicians, the parents of the participants were trained for their children's collaboration in the event,
            which increased the knowledge of the students subject to STEM education; on the other hand it also increased
            the STEM confidence level of the parents who were trained by helping the carnival's learning stations. [13].
        </p>

        <p>A holistic approach to integrating physical activities and programming into the classroom to encourage
            physical activity is the goal of CS+PA2, an effective learning model for teaching computer science, coding,
            and STEM concepts. As an example of CS+PA2 we taught an experiment, the "MathDance" program for seventh
            grade students using Tacha programming. The evaluation results (one evaluation taken before the activities,
            one after) show that the MathDance program improved students' math and computer literacy significantly. It
            also increased students' confidence in STEM classes and interest in STEM careers. Students who repeated
            MathDance moves did better, though not statistically significantly better, on a math and computer science
            test than students who did not, so ChanJin Chung and Mark Kocherovsky exposed in 2018. [14]</p>

        <p>In view of currently suffering from abrupt weather changes and as an innovative idea Aamir Fidai, Mary M.
            Capraro and Robert M. Capraro in 2018 in a joint research work practicing the role of PBL (Project Based
            Learning) STEM activities, designing and building an electric bicycle. Traditional methods of engaging
            students in science, engineering, and math activities have proven insufficient to foster equitable
            engagement among students in underrepresented countries. Therefore, there is a critical need for approaches
            that foster equity, diversity, and inclusion in engineering fields that can increase the number of students
            from underrepresented populations in engineering. [15]</p>

        <p>On the other hand, Clark M. Quintana in 2018 lays out a development of e-learning tool that facilitates the
            integration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) into plans for non-STEM selections.
            The e-learning tool is being designed to be widely accessible online and easily integrated with most K-12
            curricula. The tool focuses on enabling students to actively explore STEM-related model dependencies without
            needing to understand the underlying math and science, which is the usual barrier. Users can explore various
            outcomes by checking various input values. This effort advances previous work by integrating features that
            are likely to increase attraction to STEM. [16]</p>

        <p>From another point of view Deborah Hecht, Jennie Chiu, Ishwar Brigelal, and David Burghardt in 2018 state
            that research shows that STEM experiences in schools can influence career development. However, it helps
            students engage with science, technology, and mathematics practical concepts in out-of-school settings,
            although they can be particularly challenging as young people are often able between dropping out or
            leaving. Exploring how tablet-based technologies that support knowledge integration and informed design can
            support STEM learning outside of school. [17]</p>

        <p>Garibay M. T, Gomez J. C, Terissi L, Soria L, Marcuzzi R, Moya M, Bertinat L, Massetti A, Neumann L and
            Chavarini A in 2018 took the initiative to implement a place where creativity, innovation and hands-on
            learning come together to improve engineering education. With these goals Space Maker was created; it is a
            facility where students can develop their own projects or projects proposed by faculty members such as in
            the areas of robotics, mobile networks and signal processing as part of the courses, allowing them to teach
            STEM as well as the skills for teamwork and to communicate ideas. [18]</p>

        <p>However, Arturo Melo, Carolyn L. Beck, Jose Ismael Peña and Philip E. Para in 2018 mention that in developed
            countries it is necessary to understand how knowledge transfer (KT) occurs through human capital from
            universities to regions. Now, a KT model of human capital from university nodes to productive nodes is
            presented for seven

        <p>Colombian regions and examines how the proportion of graduates absorbed by each region generates new
            knowledge products, on the other hand the model tries to explain the dependence of knowledge products with
            science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). [19] The model is based on a model of the KT of
            human capital from universities to productive nodes for seven Colombian regions and examines how the
            proportion of graduates absorbed by each region generates new knowledge products.</p>

        <p>Seema Rivera, Mahesh K. Banavar, and Dana Barry in 2018 state that the use of mobile apps has been successful
            in the field of STEM education to college students. This method introduces science and engineering practices
            included in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The mobile app provides creative learning
            experiences for science and other STEM students. [20]</p>

        <p>From a different criterion Michael S. Rugh, Julia E. Calabrese, Robert M. Capraro, Ali Bicer, Mary M.
            Capraro, and Luciana R. Barroso in 2018 state that STEM language may be the origin of the problem when
            communicating, furthermore linguistic research has shown that confusion about specific words may be due to
            many causes such as alternative meanings or senses associated with that word. The study identified and
            categorized patterns of words and phrases that caused confusion during an engineering assignment at a STEM
            camp. The results showed that confusion about the meaning of words inhibited participants from progressing
            towards task completion. [21]</p>

        <p>In contrast, Katherine N. Vela, Ali Bicer, Cassidy Caldwell, Robert M. Capraro, and Luciana R. Barroso in
            2018 conduct research on the effect science and technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
            problem-based learning (PBL) activities have on single-sex classrooms and how these experiences affect
            students' attitudes toward STEM careers. To close the gap of women's underrepresentation in STEM, research
            suggests that single-gender classes should be implemented. [22]</p>

        <p>Similarly, Amy Eguchi and Lisbeth Uribe in 2017 state that in educational robotics or robotics in education
            is the term widely used to describe the use of robotics as a learning tool. Educational robotics is an
            effective learning tool to promote and encourage students' STEM learning being a learning tool that enhances
            students' learning experiences through hands-on learning of the mind. [23]</p>

        <p>In Australia in 2017 Robert Ross, James Whittington and Phat Huynh mention that it has been recognized for
            decades that there is a worldwide trend of a shortage of students graduating in Science, Technology,
            Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Despite the recognized need to boost productivity through
            research and development, the numbers of graduates from engineering disciplines have seen little growth over
            the past decade. Education providers at all levels recognized this downward trend and have created a vast
            array of different student engagement programs to both attract and retain students in the STEM disciplines
            at both the secondary and tertiary levels. [24]</p>

        <p>According to Stehanie Purington, Alicia Gonzales, and Elizabeth McEneany in 2017, in most classrooms it is
            observed that "homework," teachers simply gave the instructions and let students get started. We would
            encourage a different path for future iterations. To start a conversation about the math needed to complete
            the project, we would first have students read the instructions, and then we would point to the question of
            where they are asked to brainstorm ideas for for mass production. We would ask if the students know what
            mass production entails and think that the discussion would begin by explaining and defining these concepts.
            [25] We would then ask them to brainstorm ideas for mass production.</p>

        <p>On the brainwave side, Yu-Cheng Chien, Chia-Hung Lai and Yueh-Min Huang in 2017 did a study based on
            brainwave and sensor imagery to construct an attention recognition mechanism and apply it to develop a
            real-time neuro-feedback system that can maintain an effective learning state. Through the employment of
            attention recognition mechanism,
            this system can trigger a feedback to improve their attention in real time when students' reading attention
            was detected too low. Therefore, they developed a real-time neurofeedback to improve the learner's attention
            in reading e-books. In this, the participants had asked to use NeuroSky to read e-books during the
            experimental progress. Brain wave functions are automatically activated to detect the learner's attention.
            [26]</p>

        <p>Melvin Goodwin, Jacqueline Healy, Kristen Jacksa and James Whitehair in 2017 laid out strategies to address
            the main barriers to STEM-based education with these barriers being related to standardized testing and
            educator engagement. Giving results initially from students to STEM-focused and STEM-infused lessons are
            overwhelmingly positive and managers have noted much higher levels during classroom observations. [27]</p>

        <p>In turn in 2017 Jhannes Krugel and Peter Hubwieser explain that the prior knowledge of college freshmen
            varies greatly in the programming branch, giving themselves the task of creating a massive open online
            course (MOOC) representing a solution. Therefore, they designed and developed a MOOC called LOOP (Learning
            Object-Oriented Programming) that provides a gentle introduction to computational thinking and
            object-oriented concepts before the programming part. [28]</p>

        <p>Although Aini Aziziah Ramli and Nor Hasniza Ibrahim in 2017 state that STEM education is an interdisciplinary
            approach that aims to educate students in four specific disciplines rather than teaching the four
            disciplines as separate subjects; STEM education integrates cohesive learning based on real-world
            applications. [29]</p>

        <p>With the aim of achieving satisfactory results in the teaching and implementation of semester courses in
            control engineering, in which the presence of students from different disciplines is more than notorious
            Antonio Flores Caballero, Dorin Sabin Copaci, Alvaro Villoslada Pecina, Dolores Blanco Rojas and Luis Moreno
            Lorente in 2016 propose to resort to high levels of abstraction in the programming of control systems. This
            high level of abstraction comes from the use of a rapid prototyping system for advanced control, which
            allows to resort to functionalities that had not been foreseen in any rapid prototyping environment. The
            advanced nature of the system provides solutions from the highest level of abstraction, so-called
            model-based design, for the intricate relationships needed between control engineering and real-time
            computing, allowing students to focus their efforts on control algorithm development, system identification,
            and physical plant modeling rather than worrying about the tedious low-level management and configuration
            tasks of the hardware architecture they are employing. [30]</p>

        <p>From a different perspective Cooke Laquana in 2016 mentions generative STEM education in game design-based
            learning stating that STEM Education K-12 test scores have been steadily improving over the last decade in
            the United States, achievement gaps remain for minorities and women in STEM courses and careers. Game-based,
            learning methods are common models of science and technology education that provide young people with
            extrinsically motivating knowledge learning frameworks, however, research has shown that even these
            procedural spaces are often disconnected from the social and cultural realities of students. [31]</p>

        <p>Similarly, Kanyawit Klinbumrung and Somsak Akatimagool in 2016 developed a STEM-based instructional tool for
            transmission in the line engineering course. The research tool consisted of an experimental set and GUI
            simulation program for impedance and standing wave measurement characterization. [32]</p>

        <p>Now, Karl Perusich in 2016 mentions the creation of an electric go-kart camp that started in 2013 as a way to
            encourage students to choose STEM as a possible career. This camp is designed to give an overview of the
            physics, electrical and mechanical engineering, engineering associated with the design and operation of a
            battery-powered go-kart. [33]</p>

        <p>Regarding Fred J. Figliano and Gina J. Mariano in 2015 conducted a qualitative study with the goal of
            fostering the transfer of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics while working on engineering
            design problems.</p>

        <p>Teaching for transfer provides a vehicle to foster transfer of STEM content through abstraction of knowledge
            in each individual discipline. Many theoretical approaches to explaining knowledge transfer are rooted in
            the belief that knowledge becomes generalizable through its abstraction.[34] Theoretical approaches to
            explaining knowledge transfer are rooted in the belief that knowledge becomes generalizable through its
            abstraction. [34]</p>

        <p>As for David R. Granchelli and Chiamaka Agbaasi-Porter in 2015 unveil a laboratory in which they develop STEM
            programs that merge traditional academic classroom lectures with hands-on and experimental activities, with
            students having the opportunity to build and test engineering components based on the theory being taught.
            The lab is divided into two settings, for high school students and for engineering students, both programs
            involve intensive classroom lectures and hands-on activities that require students to execute. [35]</p>

        <p>Being environmentally friendly Alexander Proulx, Anthony D'Amico and Charles Thangaraj in 2015 designed and
            implemented a miniature horizontal wind turbine demonstration kit for K-12 STEM programs; in their paper
            they describe the design and prototyping implementation process.[36] In their paper they describe the design
            and implementation process of prototypes.[37] In addition to the above, they have also designed and
            implemented a demonstration kit for K-12 STEM programs.[38] In their paper they describe the design and
            prototyping process.
            However, Ramakrishnan Sundaram in 2015 spearheads an outreach program called "STEM Time" for K-12 STEM
            teachers. Such a program denotes training in engineering skills and encompasses the engineering education
            program, pre-engineering curriculum and cyber instructional networks. Teachers will be better prepared to
            teach STEM concepts and will advance their careers in STEM and engineering technology. [37]</p>

        <p>From another perspective Diego Bautista Diaz, Francisco Suarez Moreno and Jhonny Gomez Amaya in 2019 expose
            their experience carried out from the subject Technology and Computer Science, with a high school course, in
            the course of grade 9 to grade 10, in a public school in Bogota, Colombia. The main objective of this
            experience was the development and application of a curriculum plan based on the STEM (Science, technology,
            engineering and mathematics) approach in order to enhance some of their competencies (knowledge, skills and
            attitudes), as a contribution to the development of their skills and vocation for engineering careers. A
            quasi-experimental design was carried out with ninth grade students. The STEM approach, seeks to integrate
            the contents in a new disciplinary set, enhancing thinking processes (creative and critical) and problem
            solving. [38]</p>

        <p>Now, researchers Pedro Bravo Mosquera, Nelson Cisneros Insuasti, Bryann Avendaño Uribe and Fabiola Mosquera
            Rivadeneira propose in 2019 a STEM learning based on aircraft design, with the aim of promoting the
            development of aeronautical science in Colombia. This teaching strategy was developed by specialized
            instructors from the Clubes de Ciencia Colombia program, seeking to stimulate in young Colombian students
            their passion for science, technology and innovation, and in the process create an international network of
            academic collaborators.[39]</p>

        <p>However, Cristian Ferrada, Danilo Diaz Levicoy, Norma Salgado Orellana and Eduardo Puraivan in 2019 perform
            and describe the results of a bibliometric analysis of STEM scientific production in the SCOPUS database,
            between the years 2010 and 2018. The study consisted of analyzing a total of 65 documents published in that
            database, with the variables provided therein. The results show that STEM education is a proliferating
            topic, by identifying the relevant areas and key words on the subject, as well as the countries and media in
            which they are published.[40] The results show that STEM education is a topic in proliferation.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, Gonzalo Bonilla Bravo, Jon Azcona Esteban, Luis Javier Ulloa Meneses and Willian Javier
            Ocampo Pazos in 2018 make known the importance of the practical component within a career such as
            engineering and present to the community an alternative that serves as part of a perfectly applicable
            educational environment. To this end, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education is
            introduced, which is an emerging trend that seeks modular, adaptable and easy-to-use tools that help the
            student in the process of practical teaching. In this particular case, the Arduino platform has been chosen
            as an applicative, due to its large community and existing

            free hardware movement. [41] The STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) program is a
            program that is based on the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) program.</p>

        <p>The STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) Robotics UNIMINUTO-iCargnegie program headed by
            Viviana Garzón Cardozo in 2016, develops competencies of high school students in STEM areas and enhances
            21st century skills. This program exemplifies the pedagogical perspective of learning-by-doing, focused on
            the study and based on the formulation of projects, design and exploration of challenges and modeling of
            roles and responsibilities of engineers. The program develops these skills using the knowledge of
            professionals in different areas of engineering such as: programming, flowcharts, pseudocode, mechanical
            models, C programming language, sensing, mobile robotics, among others. [42] The program is designed to
            develop the skills of engineers in the 21st century.</p>

        <p class="titulo">Results and Discussion</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Discussion Problem</p>

        <p>Two of the major areas of knowledge that contribute the greatest amount of scientific and technological
            progress in humanity are the Natural Sciences and Engineering and Technology, from which there are a number
            of areas and disciplines of study that involve in most of their knowledge the natural sciences, engineering
            and technology.</p>

        <p>In different parts of the world, the lack of interest of young people in studying the disciplines of these
            areas is evident
            [7] and [24], one of the possible causes of this problem would be reflected by the assignment of tasks
            without any instruction, where the student would have to face science problems without specific guidance
            from a tutor, according to study addressed by [25]. Another cause of young people's disinterest in the study
            of scientific careers is the lack of knowledge on the part of educators about the social and cultural
            realities of multi-gender students, as explained by [31], as well as the gender inequity in the choice of
            young people to pursue professional programs in science according to their biological sexuality and/or
            diversity, as indicated by [22] in his research. These contributions and research studies reveal three main
            factors that are presented as causes of the low demand of young people interested in pursuing careers in the
            areas of science, engineering and technology. These causes are described sequentially in Figure 3.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Effects Analysis</p>

        <p>As mentioned by [7], the lack of engineers in countries such as the United States and Guatemala is evident in
            the industry of these countries, reducing the number of qualified personnel to occupy positions in which
            personnel must be trained in science and technology activities. The low demand causes the transfer of
            knowledge to companies and regions to be limited, as mentioned by [19]. Developed countries face this type
            of effects by motivating and devising different programs to maintain or transmit the interest to be educated
            in engineering and science careers. Colombia is one of the countries that, although in some of its regions
            it has improved, there is still a lack of motivation among young people to study careers related to
            engineering and technology, causing the effect described in Figure 4.</p>

        <p class="titulo">Results for Solution Alternatives</p>

        <p>Giving timely response to the need to encourage young people to choose to study careers related to science
            and engineering, led different researchers to join in the task of focusing efforts to devise strategies to
            solve the lack of scientists, which is why in the mid-90s and as a pioneer the National Science Foundation
            which is a government agency of the United States promoted the STEM initiative, which focused on the study
            of four of the major areas of knowledge in which its main actors are scientists and engineers.</p>

        <p>The STEM has shown evidence that through this initiative, it is involved towards the acquisition of active
            learning, providing aids in achieving specific achievements quite timely and necessary for industry and
            development through the transfer of knowledge that is why [3] and [29] through their research show that
            through this it reduces student failure in the study of science. As learning models, PBL is linked which is
            the project-based learning methodology through instructions or research, because of this [8] and [9] based
            on this methodology PBL added to STEM show how students combine interests, skills and abilities in the
            acquisition of specific knowledge with projects such as building drones or learning through virtual reality,
            while [15] through the construction of an electric bicycle shows how trainees developed their skills and met
            the expected expectations.</p>

        <p>Other teaching modalities linked to STEM are MOOCs for its acronym in English, which are focused as massive
            open online courses and LOOPs which are object-oriented programming apprenticeships [28] and [41] show how
            software engineering can be taught based on STEM through the methodologies mentioned above, contributing to
            knowledge transfer and industrial growth in the development of computer science and engineering and based on
            learning the skills needed for industry 4.0. Figure 5 shows a hierarchical order of how the methodologies
            used for STEM are used in some sectors.</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Applications</p>

        <p>The developments achieved in science, technology, engineering and mathematics as sub areas of specialized
            knowledge, motivate the actors interested in knowing first hand the progress generated, that is why the
            sample of how engineering education has evolved and what role it is currently occupying regarding issues
            such as the applications of STEM in the 4 specific areas of knowledge, and how these forge footprint in
            dissimilar national and international territories. Some of the areas of application for STEM are those
            mentioned in Figure 6. Research such as that of [17] shows that STEM experiences influence the development
            of careers where it is implemented, as well as [18] shows in his study that through the creation of a
            facility called Space Maker students learn skills in robotics, mobile networks and signal processing.</p>

        <p>Control prototyping is another field that can be studied using STEM, so [30] mentions the so-called
            model-based design, for the intricate relationships needed between control engineering and real-time
            computing, allowing students to focus on control algorithm development, and identify systems and physical
            plant modeling instead of worrying about management and configuration tasks. On the other hand [32] applies
            a transmission line-based instructional tool using GUI simulation software for impedance and standing wave
            measurement, facilitating student understanding, for [33] and [34] STEM can be approached through knowledge
            abstraction experiences, through activities where the student is invited to develop their capabilities in
            seeking and achieving goals for a specific purpose , through
            the construction and testing of engineering components based on the theory that is taught, as mentioned by
            [35] the use of kits such as wind turbines which are used by [36] allow the student to study the design and
            prototyping to get into the specific operation of wind turbines, the design of aircraft is one of the bets
            of [39] to get into the teaching of prototyping and operation of aircraft and the study of free hardware
            based on the research of [41]. The ICARNAGE strategy of [42] shows the applications of one of the higher
            education institutions in Colombia to teach robotics through STEM with the methodology of learning by doing
            and involves the PBL methodology to achieve the proposed objectives, confident that the student can develop
            their skills and be prepared to meet the needs of the market. That is why STEM is positioned as one of the
            main source to prepare future scientists and engineers to face the transfer of knowledge on issues related
            to Industry 4.0 and the needs of the market, industry and education, etc.</p>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>Science, technology, engineering and mathematics are positioned as a strategy in the teaching-learning
            process, to achieve meaningful student learning.</p>

        <p>The teaching-learning process, supported by science, technology, engineering and mathematics, leads the
            student to active learning, contributing to the development of personal capacities and abilities.</p>

        <p>The experiences of science, technology, engineering and mathematics influence not only the abilities of the
            student, but also the development of careers with a scientific approach.</p>
        <p>Extracurricular activities related to the prototyping and application of knowledge, strengthen the
            appropriation of science, technology, engineering and mathematics and help the student to break their
            paradigms.</p>

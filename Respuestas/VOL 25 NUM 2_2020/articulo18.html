	<!--Introduction-->
	<p class="titulo"> <b>Introduction</b>
	<p>

	<p>According to the report presented by the United Nations in 2015 "Energy for all", around 90% of the developed or
		emerging regions worldwide have access to electricity supply. In the world, according to the report in 2017 of
		International Energy Agency, the projected energy demand for 2040 will grow by 30% with respect to the demand
		consumed in 2017. These demonstrate the importance that represents the supply of energy for today's society,
		which is why the generating plants must guarantee reliability in the provision of this service <a href="#r1">[1]</a>. For this,
		equipment has been developed to monitor, supervise, control and protect the mechanical and electrical
		components, among which are the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and the relays <a href="#r2">[2]</a>. These devices protect
		the plant against abnormal operating conditions <a href="#r3">[3]</a> and its implementation has reduced the number of accidents
		like Three Mile Island Pennsylvania, in the US on March 28, 1979 <a href="#r4">[4]</a>, <a href="#r5">[5]</a> where a short circuit in the plant
		operated at 97% of maximum capacity (1000 Mv), start an escape of radioactive water. The widespread use of these
		monitoring and control mechanisms allows knowing and storing information about the state of the devices that
		make up the generation plants <a href="#r3">[3]</a>. This information allows the implementation of new fault detection and
		diagnosis techniques based on the use of intelligent systems. Currently, intelligent systems are a branch of
		artificial intelligence that allows to provide knowledge and experience on a specific domain to a machine, with
		the aim that it develops a specific activity. Intelligent systems (SI) are developed using techniques such as
		fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms and rule-based systems. Each of these techniques gives the SI
		different qualities, which is why it is important to know in detail each technique to determine the
		characteristics that the developed tool will have <a href="#r6">[6]</a>.</p>

	<p>This article presents a description of the main techniques used in the creation of SI dedicated to the diagnosis
		of failures in power plants. At the end of each technique, a table is presented with the investigations found to
		perform detection and diagnosis of failures based on SI using this technique.</p>

	<p><b>Methodology for the analysis of articles</b></p>

	<p>The methodology of this article initially describes the concept of faults in electric power plants, then
		describes the concept of intelligent system and finally describes some of the techniques used in the fault
		diagnosis in power plants.</p>

	<p><b>Faults in Power Plants</b></p>

	<p>According to what is stated in <a href="#r1">[1]</a>, electric generation plants are those that transform a type of base energy
		into electric energy. Currently, the main generation systems include thermoelectric, hydroelectric, solar and
		wind power plants. These systems involve in its operation different elements that can be classified as
		mechanical and electrical, therefore, the failures that may occur in these power plants are mechanical or
		electrical, where a fault is defined as a state of operation outside the nominal or admissible values of the
		system.</p>

	<p>Therefore, power plants have implemented protection systems, which allows to clear the fault to reduce or
		mitigate the negative effects that these can cause on the system. Currently, protection systems use devices
		called PLCs and relays <a href="#r7">[7]</a> which have different protection functions (PF) previously parameterized <a href="#r8">[8]</a>.</p>

	<p>When a fault occurs, the personnel dedicated to the identification and diagnosis of faults analyze the
		information generated by the PLC and the Relay, handling large volumes of information <a href="#r7">[7]</a>, which makes evident
		the need for tools based on intelligent systems that can assimilate the experience of human experts and organize
		the information associated with the fault to speed up diagnostic processes.</p>

	<p><b>Intelligent Systems (SI)</b></p>

	<p>Intelligent systems are computational tools that implement artificial intelligence techniques with the objective
		of providing knowledge and experience on a specific procedure of a machine <a href="#r9">[9]</a>. For the development of an
		intelligent system there are several techniques that can be implemented according to the type of application,
		for this reason it is of great importance to study each of these techniques before starting the development of
		an intelligent system <a href="#r10">[10]</a>.</p>

	<p>Below are the main techniques used in the development of intelligent systems focused on the detection and
		diagnosis of faults in power plants.</p>

	<p><b>Fuzzy logic</b></p>

	<p>"Fuzzy logic is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows a computer to analyze real-world information
		on a scale between the false and the true", this technique emulates human decision making, which reasons into a
		realm of assertions partially true thanks to common sense <a href="#r9">[9]</a>.</p>

	<p>

		<span class="captionS"><b>Figure 1: </b>Structure of a fuzzy logic system.</span><br>
		<span class="captionS"><b>Source: </b> <a href="#r11">[11]</a>.</span><br>
	</div>
	</p>

	<p>According to <a href="#r11">[11]</a> fuzzy logic is widely used in applications where there is no mathematical model that describes
		the system; Therefore, these types of applications can be modeled by adapting the values of the variables to
		qualitative values and subsequently defining rules that allow make inferences in these applications. It can be
		seen in Table 1, the main investigations developed in power generation plants using fuzzy logic for the
		detection and diagnosis of faults.</p>

	<p>

			logic.</span><br>
		<span class="captionS"><b>Source: </b> Authors.</span><br>
	</div>
	</p>

	<p>This technique can be easily implemented in cases where the rules that make up the knowledge base are subjective
		or difficult to specify, since it allows the use of natural language in its construction <a href="#r9">[9]</a>. It also has great
		potential for managing processes in which there is uncertainty in the input data due to the way in which this
		technique is constituted; however, the need to work with other techniques to improve the performance of the
		tools developed is evident.</p>

	<p><b>Neural Networks</b></p>

	<p>Neural networks are computation techniques inspired by biological models that imitate the reasoning process of
		the human brain, for this the neural network takes solved problems as examples to find relationships and build
		its own network, which classifies information to make decisions <a href="#r9">[9]</a>, <a href="#r10">[10]</a>.</p>

	<p>The neural network is made up of three main layers, as can be seen in Figure 2, the input layer where the data is
		entered, the hidden layer made up of one or several layers depending on the complexity of the network and the
		output layer, for more information see <a href="#r22">[22]</a>.</p>

		<span class="captionS"><b>Source: </b> <a href="#r22">[22]</a>.</span><br>
	</div>
	</p>

	<p>Neural networks offer the advantage of adaptive learning, self-organization, fault tolerance, real-time
		operation, and easy implementation in current technology</p>

	<p>In Table 2 presents the research developed for the detection and diagnosis of failures in power plants using
		intelligent systems based on neural networks. The main quality of this technique is that it offers a solution to
		cases where it cannot or is very complicated to extract the knowledge of specialists to formulate a knowledge
		base. The neural networks present as limiting the great amount of information that the network requires for its
		training, limiting to a great extent its field of application.</p>

	<p>

	</div>
	</p>

	<p><b>Knowledge-based systems</b></p>

	<p>According to <a href="#r30">[30]</a>, knowledge-based systems are defined as those that "contain the erudition of a human specialist
		versed in a specific field of application". With this technique it is possible to condense the knowledge of
		human specialists in such a way that it can be accessed and processed by computers, obtaining computer models
		with the reasoning and problem-solving capacities of human specialists within an established domain.</p>

	<p>It can be seen in Figure 3 the generic architecture of a knowledge-based system <a href="#r9">[9]</a>, in which its main components
		and actors are identified.</p>

	<p>
	<div class="imagen cuadro" id="pub_rev18_graf5">
		<img width="500px" src="img/pub_rev18_graf5.png" class="image"><br>
		<span class="captionS"><b>Figure 3: </b>general architecture knowledge-based systems.</span><br>
		<span class="captionS"><b>Source: </b> Authors.</span><br>
	</div>
	</p>

	<p>Knowledge-based systems are composed mainly of the knowledge base, place where all the information of human
		specialists is stored, the knowledge of specialists is represented into rules and objects of type IF ... THEN,
		so that they can be accessed by the inference engine, which relates user inputs that can be in the form of
		questions with rules and objects to get an answer <a href="#r10">[10]</a>.</p>

	<p>Next, Table 3 presents the main research focused on the detection and diagnosis of power plant failures using
		knowledge-based techniques. However, there is a difficulty in the application of this technique in cases where
		there is uncertainty in the diagnosis, since the system is only capable of diagnosing the cases of failure that
		have been contemplated previously. Another difficulty observed in the development of this technique is the
		difficulty of extracting all the knowledge of human specialists to cover all cases of failure.</p>

			using knowledge-based systems.</span><br>
		<span class="captionS"><b>Source: </b> Authors.</span><br>
	</div>
	</p>

	<p><b>Bayesian Networks</b></p>

	<p>Bayesian networks are graphs that represent information through a set of variables and the dependency relations
		between them. In this way a Bayesian network can represent the probabilistic relationships between a fault and
		the symptoms of a system.</p>

	<p>These networks are built on DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) graphs as shown in Figure 4, where each node represents
		a random variable and the edges represent conditional dependencies.</p>

	<p>

			generation plants using intelligent systems based on Bayesian networks.</span><br>
		<span class="captionS"><b>Source: </b> Authors.</span><br>
	</div>
	</p>

	<p>In the investigations presented in Table 4 it is observed that the intelligent systems developed under this
		technique present a great deal of uncertainty, which allows decisions to be made with partial input information.
		According to the above, it is considered that Bayesian networks give intelligent systems the ability to
		determine possible solutions from fragments of information in their entry. As a difficulty in the application of
		Bayesian networks is establish all the relationships between the different symptoms and types of failure so that
		the network can make a more approximate diagnosis.</p>

	<p><b>Hybrid techniques</b></p>

	<p>Up to this moment some of the most used techniques in the development of intelligent systems have been presented,
		each one of these techniques presents qualities and deficiencies during its application, reason why it can be
		assured that a perfect technique does not exist to develop intelligent systems, this has taken to develop
		systems that integrate different techniques of artificial intelligence, obtaining as result the denominated
		hybrid techniques.</p>

	<p>In Table 5 is presented a compilation of the research developed with hybrid techniques that have had the greatest
		impact in recent years to detect and diagnose failures in power plants.</p>

	<p>

			diagnosis of failures in power generation plants.</span><br>
		<span class="captionS"><b>Source: </b> Authors.</span><br>
	</div>
	</p>

	<p>The hybrid techniques allow to increase the field of action of the proposed projects without worrying about the
		limiting particularities of each technique.</p>

	<!--Results and discussion-->
	<p class="titulo"> <b>Results and discussion</b> </p>

	<p>Table 6 shows a comparative evaluation between the different techniques presented in this work; with this
		evaluation the reader can compare the advantages and disadvantages of intelligent systems developed by each of
		the artificial intelligence techniques.</p>

	<p>
	<div class="imagen cuadro" id="pub_rev18_graf10">

		<span class="captionS"><b>Table VI: </b>Comparison of artificial intelligence techniques.</span><br>
		<span class="captionS"><b>Source: </b> Authors.</span><br>
	</div>
	</p>

	<p>According to the foregoing, it is considered that for the development of an intelligent system to detect and
		diagnose faults in a power plant, hybrid techniques must be included to comply with a greater number of
		attributes that allow for a more complete solution, maintaining a simple design and direct application.</p>

	<!--Conclusions-->
	<p class="titulo"> <b>Conclusions</b> </p>

	<p>This article presents an evaluation of the main techniques used in the development of intelligent systems,
		seeking to provide the reader with a primary source of information on these techniques and their application in
		the problem of failure analysis in power plants. On the other hand, the reader will have criteria to determine
		the technique that best fits the complexity of his own system.</p>

	<p>There are multiple intelligent systems techniques that can be used in the solution of different problems,
		therefore, the characteristics of each problem and the resources available must be analyzed carefully before
		selecting the technique.</p>

	<p>The fuzzy technique acquires greater relevance when working in hybrid form with other techniques of artificial
		intelligence that allow to relate the interpretation of data that this one offers.</p>

	<p>Neural networks are highly applicable in systems where it is very complex to extract the knowledge of human
		specialists, or this knowledge evolves over time, its main deficiency is in the large number of data required
		for training, limiting its application to diagnostic systems where there is extensive documentation of symptoms
		and consequences.</p>

	<p>Systems based on knowledge present an excellent performance in a specific domain when the capture of knowledge is
		done in an adequate way, since its efficiency depends on the quality of the knowledge base.</p>

	<p>The systems that present a better behavior are those where hybrid techniques are implemented, since they
		compensate for the weaknesses of each technique. For example, this work was used by the authors to select the
		appropriate techniques for the development of an intelligent hybrid system for fault diagnosis in a
		hydroelectric power station, obtaining the combination of expert systems and Bayesian networks since these
		techniques fit the available information.</p>
